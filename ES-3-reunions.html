            <p>As I entered the Curlicue, I felt a flat surface beneath my feet, but I saw no sign the room was delimited by walls or floors. I instinctively knew this was an illusion, an awareness I was grateful for. To the untrained eye, I would have appeared to be suspended in space. Structures floated beneath my feet and empty space extended beyond. A stunning projection of Ryde’s Largess filled the opposite side of the room. There was little to see, in truth. Ryde’s was a black hole: the literal absence of light. Its dense mass reflected no light, as no light could escape its horizon. But that ever-present ring of wispy, yellow-blue light swung in a near-perfect circle, betraying Ryde’s presence. I knew of black holes. But so too had Chris. Was my knowledge born from me or him, or both? This unclear distinction between my selves caused a sudden disturbance within me. <i>To know something twice, as two persons...</i></p>

            <p>Just then, a voice called out, quickly pulling me from the brink. “Dallat, over here!”</p>

            <p>It was a soft voice that Chris would have considered feminine, though like me, there was little of her anatomy that suggested sex of any kind. She sat in a floating chair that resembled a large egg with its interior scooped out. In general terms, she resembled myself. Same structure, same general configuration. But her body was not black like mine; it was blue like the sea, interrupted by waves that seemed to crash across her skin, foam rushing in lines across her body. <i>Aandh</i>. Her legs were tucked beneath her as she analyzed white data crawling rapidly in the black space before her. She then dismissed the data and the room-wide projection of Ryde’s with one elegant swipe. The Curlicue was now white, much like the rest of the <i>Dole</i>. Only now I could make out faint filigrees embossed into the walls and floor; their hue only slightly darker than the room itself. <i>Cream</i>, I thought. <i>Like Chris’s bathroom tiles</i>. Aandh gracefully hopped from her capsule and approached me.</p>

            <p>“The others will be here soon. Kai will be late, I expect.”</p>

            <p><i>Kai</i>. Another name I recognized. I quickly searched my mind for any recollections of Kai and found only vague disapproval.</p>

            <p>“I’m sorry. I’m not myself at the moment,” I apologized.</p>

            <p>“Ohhhh, that’s right,” Aandh drawled. “You went in <i>blind</i>. As did Gestus, I think. He’s likely feeling out of sorts as well.”</p>

            <p>“Phet has been bringing me up to speed, but it's not piecing together as fast as I’d like,” I admitted.</p>

            <p>“That’s alright, Dallat. Custom dictates the blinded go last, so you’ll have plenty of time to pull it all together.”</p>

            <p>“And whose custom is that?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“Ours: You, me, Kai, Zella, and Gestus. We… er… swap stories between Schemes. Those that went in blinded — that is, those that weren’t themselves — they tell their stories last. Which, to be honest, is usually you and Gestus.”</p>

            <p>I lingered on that last piece of information, dubious at the notion that I would ever willingly subject myself to the life of Chris Mayhew or any other godforsaken wretch while willingly stripping myself of any awareness of my true self; to rid myself of that one compensation that no matter how miserable I may be, it wasn’t real. Just then, an opening in the walls of the Curlicue appeared a few meters away.</p>

            <p>“Greetings! Aandh. Dallat.”</p>

            <p>I swung my head around to see the new arrival float into the Curlicue. While Aandh and I may have retained a vestigial humanoid anatomy, the tau entering resembled a floating mass of gelatin, suspended by an unseen force into a near-perfect spheroid shape. Its jelly interior was reddish-pink like a peach and, disturbingly, appeared quite appetizing. <i>This is Kai</i>. Their presence triggered a wave of memory and speculation. Only Kai could assume such a tediously “inventive” frame. The fact that it appeared tasty was surely intentional. Perhaps some new hue intended to answer the question: what color is best suited to trigger hunger? Then again, tau did not eat. No, the effect was likely born of something more invasive. Perhaps Kai released some medium into the air, surreptitiously tampering with the neural receptors of spectators such as Aandh and myself. <i>Not bad</i>, I admitted to myself. </p>

            <p>“Another cycle, another frame,” Aandh sighed as she tiredly glanced in Kai’s direction then promptly returned her attention to a newly summoned data stream.</p>

            <p>“Don’t pretend you don’t like it, Aandh,” Kai’s voice rumbled. “Sure. I like it alright. Better than the last frame.”</p>

            <p>“That we can agree on. My experience as a reptilian was, however brief, rather uncomfortable.”</p>

            <p>Kai paused, its shape seeming to turn on an unseen axis in my direction, presumably noticing that I was gawking at his unhuman frame.</p>

            <p>“What’s wrong with Dallat?” Kai asked Aandh.</p>

            <p>“Hmm? Oh, don’t mind him. He’s just come from a blinded Scheme.” she answered casually.</p>

            <p>“Again? You and Gestus, I swear. Masochists of the highest order.”</p>

            <p>“Unfortunately, I’m inclined to agree,” I mumbled. “I’m sorry, did you say “reptilian?””</p>

            <p>Before Kai could answer, a new voice interjected. “Not just any reptilian, Dallat. An ophidix of the tenth-decieon, pre-dormancy: what was, essentially, a winged crocodile. Designed by ancient geneticists to return the reptiles to their roots, so to speak. A self-indulgence typical of the era.”</p>

            <p>This new voice emerged from a frame that was, as Chris Mayhew would have recognized, a male human. Brown-skinned, bipedal, with nose, lips, toes: all those primordial human features. His hair and beard were black, long, oiled, and immaculately curled. And he wore layers of colored robes that flowed to the floor of the Curlicue. Aandh swept her data stream away again and rushed to admire the new arrival’s frame.</p>

            <p>“My god, Zella, it’s incredible. What is it? Goodness, looks ancient.”</p>

            <p>“Ancient Akkadian,” Zella beamed, in a highly affected tone.</p>

            <p>“So. <i>Very ancient</i>,” Aandh gawked, reaching out, twirling her fingers through his beard.</p>

            <p>Kai’s imposing frame then floated toward Zella. “It is quite something, my friend. Beautiful, really. I’m impressed. Even if a bit... erm... academic.” Kai remarked, uttering the last word with a suggestion of disapproval.</p>

            <p>Ignoring Kai’s backhanded compliment, Zella turned to me. “Has Gestus arrived yet?”</p>

            <p>Sensing my hesitation, Aandh answered for me, explaining to Zella that the last of our companions was yet to show. Zella shrugged then turned to Kai and began admiring his gelatin body. As Zella and Kai exchanged compliments, and Kai demonstrated his ability to ripple his frame in grotesque waves, Aandh approached me.</p>

            <p>“Dallat, why don’t you go fetch Gestus? He’s probably in need of some gentle prodding.”</p>

            <p>I nodded hesitantly, searching my mind. Where do I find Gestus? I wondered. Rather than pestering Aandh questions, I decided instead to venture outside the Curlicue and solve the matter on my own. As I left the room, my companions bantering behind me, I returned to the long, curving hall of the <i>Dole</i>.</p>

            <p>Phet’s disembodied voice addressed me as I strode through the hall:</p>

            <p>“Hello, Dallat. I gather you’re looking for Gestus?”</p>

            <p>“Yes. He’s late. Aandh sent me to fetch him,” I answered.</p>

            <p>“Well, I’m looking at him as we speak. He’s just down the way.”</p>

            <p>I found Gestus peering out a window in the direction of Ryde’s. Gestus’ frame was much like my own: unremarkable, austere. Though his exterior was not black like mine, but translucent. I could see Ryde's distorted through his body. As I approached I realized that while Gestus’ gaze seemed to be directed at Ryde’s, as I looked at his face, it was clear his mind was elsewhere.</p>

            <p>“Gestus?” I gently called.</p>

            <p>He blinked and looked from the window. A weak smile formed across his translucent face.</p>

            <p>“Dallat. How wonderful to see you.”</p>

            <p>Gestus’ voice was smooth and warm, with a familiar resonance. <i>I love this tau</i>, I knew then. Like Aandh, Gestus was a person I yearned to be around.</p>

            <p>“Is everything alright?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“Just the usual, I suppose,” Gestus replied blankly.</p>

            <p>“Was your Scheme... um... blind?” I asked. “Mine was.”</p>

            <p>Gestus turned back to the window.</p>

            <p>“Not this time. I thought to save myself the discomfort this time around, on Aandh’s recommendation. Even so, I lost myself. My experience was… well, I was foolish,” Gestus paused, lost in memory. Returning his gaze to me, Gestus continued, “Anyways, there will be enough time later.”</p>

            <p>I wanted to console Gestus, but I didn’t know what to say. He seemed in pain. But there was no comfort I could give. Not in the state I was in.</p>

            <p>“The others are waiting, I assume. Let’s be on our way,” Gestus said as he quickly turned from the window and began to walk.</p>

            <p>I nodded and fell into step with him as we left to convene with our companions.</p>
