            <p id="gallianism-entry"></p><p><b>Gallianism:</b> A philosophical movement founded by the ichor Ruustus in 56 A.A. Gallianism teaches that individuals owe their highest allegiance to themselves, unburdened by gods, souls, or ideologies. Though associated with Galli, the Adonian god of pleasure, Gallians are staunch atheists who typically celebrate personal fulfillment through art, indulgence, and revelry. Ironically, Ruustus herself lives an austere and solitary life, valuing strict asceticism as her own path to satisfaction.</p>

Convinced that reality is a collective illusion born from a primordial rupture, Searchers obsessively sift through the material world in hopes of locating this Bauble and reuniting with Tiamuriam.

            <h2>Geography/People</h2>

            <p id="adoniah-entry"></p><p><b>Adoniah:</b> A disunified network of coastal city-states, known for its merchant culture and naval prowess. Adonians share customs, language, and a religious pantheon despite political fragmentation. Adoniah divides into Mainland Adoniah and Colonial Adoniah. Mainland Adoniah consists of the original five city-states along the Twin Rivers littoral, while Colonial Adoniah encompasses their respective overseas colonies.</p>

            <p><i>Adoniah and the Adonians are inspired by Ancient Phoenicia and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="atinae-entry"></p><p><b>Atinae:</b> Once a modest coastal polis, Atinae has emerged as the intellectual heart of Drys, its marble amphitheaters and obsidian lecture domes now rivaling the older fortresses of Drycenae in prestige. Situated inland atop a wooded plateau, the city is famed for its scholastic assemblies, where pre-Socratic theorists debate the structure of reality, often under Ark-powered lanterns that glow with suspended plasma. A small relay spire hums at the city’s edge, gifted by an Ichorian delegation and used sparingly by its philosophers to transmit treatises to sister cities. Though Atinae maintains little military significance, its thinkers have begun to reshape Dryic identity — and perhaps, in time, its place among the Great Kingdoms.</p>

            <p><i>Atinae is inspired by the ancient Greek city of Athens. Notably, this draws from later archaic, pre-Socratic, and classical stages in Greek history when contrasted to the Mycenaean inspirations of greater Drys.</i></p>

            <p id="bamatiplains-entry"></p><p><b>Bamati Plains:</b> A fertile region of red soil that lies to the east of Qeret and Erutu along the coast of the Twin Rivers.</p>

            <p id="cerulean-entry"></p><p><b>Cerulean Sea:</b> A vast, central body of water in Kassatím, linking the eastern Great Kingdoms of Combassyia, Makaria, and Netusha with the western Great Kingdoms of Léu, Knakros, and Drys.</p>
           
            <p id="colonialadoniah-entry"></p><p><b>Colonial Adoniah:</b> A noncontiguous region comprising the five colonies of Adoniah: Taath, Ybaala, Chassika, Atrapat, and Bora.</p>

            <p><i>Colonial Adoniah is inspired loosely by the colonies of Ancient Phoenicia.</i></p>

            <p id="combassyia-entry"></p><p><b>Combassyia/Combassyians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Combassyia is a militaristic society led by the despotic God-King Banipahl Byzes, who rules from the capital of Scintevah. Renowned for its powerful standing armies, Combassyia commands the northern Twin-Rivers region from the coast to the Akroz Mountains. While striving to rival Makaria’s cultural achievements, it also enforces a Pre-Ark societal structure where religion underpins state power. The Cult of Sarkosh, the kingdom’s patron deity, serves as a central pillar of Combassyian society, influencing governance, conquest, and daily life. The Adonian Mainland, including Qeret, is currently under Combassyian control.</p>

            <p><i>Combassyia and the Combassyians are inspired by Ancient Assyria and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="dactos-entry"></p><p><b>Dactos:</b> A Knakriti isle where the Ark landed in 1 A.A., now home only to scientists, scholars, and reclusive eccentrics.</p>

            <p id="drycenae-entry"></p><p><b>Drycenae:</b> The capital of Drys. Drycenae sprawls across a craggy hillside where cyclopean steel walls surround an austere city of humble wooden abodes and ancient limestone fortresses. From its central citadel, the Anax of Drys, Akaidamas, governs with tenuous authority, presiding over a coalition of feuding Dryic city-kings whose loyalty is maintained only through threat, bribery, and dubious tradition. The Ark's influence on Drycenae is present, though understated, for the city's pride lies in its brutal simplicity.</p>

            <p><i>Drycenae is inspired by the ancient Mycenaean Greek city of Mycenae.</i></p>

            <p id="drys-entry"></p><p><b>Drys/Dryics:</b> One of Kassatím's six great kingdoms. Drys, pronounced "<i>driss</i>," is renowned for its warlike culture and maritime prowess. Positioned on a vast peninsula and encompassing an extensive archipelago, Drys is ruled by a warlord from its capital, Drycenae. Though disjointed, its belligerent demeanor has secured its Great Kingdom status. Recently, Drys has experienced a philosophical renaissance, fostering some of humanity's most advanced scientific minds, contrasting its reputation for fractious squabbling and piracy.</p>

            <p><i>Drys and the Dryics are inspired by Ancient Mycenaean Greece and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="erutu-entry"></p><p><b>Erutu:</b> A city of Mainland Adoniah. It lies on the western littoral of the Twin Rivers, at the northern end of the Bamati Plains. It claims the honor of being the oldest Adonian city: a distinction that Qeret also claims. Its daughter city is Ybaala.</p>

            <i>Erutu is inspired by the ancient Phoenician city of Sidon.</i>

            <p id="ixia-entry"></p><p><b>Ixia:</b> A small Léusian town to the west of the capital city, Lux, across the Zanhir River. Notably, it is the site of the five Great Pyramids of Ixia, constructed in millennia past as elaborate tombs for ancient kings of Léu known as the Nesurai. Now, the pyramids serve a different function. The marbles, once encased in marble, have now been augmented with Ark-derived computer systems specifically designed to maintain the digital system of direct democracy that the modern Léusian system now operates by.</p>

            <p><i>Ixia is inspired by the ancient Egyptian settlement of Giza.</i></p>

            <p id="kassatim-entry"></p><p><b>Kassatím:</b> The known world. Once inhabited solely by humans, it is now shared with Ark Aliens. It includes six great kingdoms — Knakros, Léu, Drys, Netusha, Makaria, and Combassyia — alongside the ten city-states of Adoniah.</p>

            <p><i>Kassatím is inspired by the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean societies of the Bronze Age.</i></p>

            <p id="knakros-entry"></p><p><b>Knakros/Knakriti:</b> One of Kassatím's six great kingdoms. Knakros is an archipelago, located just north of Léu, inhabited by the Knakriti people. Though renowned for their immense navy, they are a peaceful people. The Ark landed on Dactos, a Knakriti isle, making them the first to encounter Ark Aliens. Knakriti society has since embraced Ark technologies and customs more than any other culture of the world. The majority of the Knakriti population reside in the capital city of Taur. </p>

            <p><i>Knakros and the Knakriti are inspired by Ancient Crete and the Minoans.</i></p>

            <p id="leu-entry"></p><p><b>Léu/Léusians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Léu is both a nation and a continent located on the southern Cerulean. It is a prosperous powerhouse of both technology and culture and is renowned for its monumental pyramids of Ixia and vibrant cities like its capital, Lux. The Léusians operate under a digital direct democracy and the kingdom’s egalitarian ethos attracts many immigrants to its shores. The Léusians thrive on exports of wheat, gold, stone, and Ark tech. It rivals Makaria and Combassyia in both age and influence but has abandoned its former militaristic ambitions since the Ark’s arrival.</p>

            <p><i>Léu and the Léusians are inspired by Ancient Egypt and its peoples.</i></p>
            
            <p id="libnush-entry"></p><p><b>Libnush Forest:</b> A sprawling cedar forest of the Adonian Mainland located east of the Qereti Isles and directly south of Mt. Betta. Known for its towering cedar groves and dense underbrush, the Libnush is also home to a furtive population of Prodigians. The forest is steeped in religious significance, believed to be the site of the first peace brokering between Qeret and Erutu. According to tradition, the event was mediated by Agatir herself, the Adonian God of War and Peace. To this day, truces and negotiations between Adonian cities are customarily conducted beneath the Libnush’s towering cedars, with offerings left at sacred groves, called “libnushes,” in Agatir's honor. </p>

            <p id="lusawat-entry"></p><p><b>Lusawat:</b> A semi-autonomous and obscenely wealthy city on the western coast of Netusha, overlooking the Southern Tarwa Strait and, consequently, the single most lucrative trade route in Kassatím. Though nominally subject to King Zet of Netusha, Lusawat and its ruling house have long operated with considerable autonomy, a tradition long predating the Ark’s arrival. Its towering bronze-clad walls have repelled no fewer than five Dryic invasions. Rumors stir that the High-King of Drys, Akaidamas, intends to unite his quarrelsome city-kings and unleash a historic force to claim the city at last.</p>

            <p><i>Lusawat is inspired by the ancient Hittite vassalage of Wilusa and of mythical Troy.</i></p>

            <p id="lux-entry"></p><p><b>Lux:</b> The capital of Léu. Lux stretches along the eastern banks of the Ankh River, its skyline a serrated vista of immense crystalline pylons and half-buried pyramids. Beneath its paved streets, the city's skein network distributes not only power and data, but governance itself. Each citizen bears neural laces that link directly to this network, which in turn interfaces with the Nesurai civic-pyramids in neighboring Ixia, allowing participation in an interminable stream of referendums.</p>

            <p><i>Lux is inspired by the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis.</i></p>

            <p id="mainlandadoniah-entry"></p><p><b>Mainland Adoniah:</b> A coastal region of the Twin Rivers. It encompasses the first five Adonian cities: Qeret, Erutu, Gabal, Braamapat, and Deshka. As of 284 A.A., each of the five is a vassal-state of Combassyia.</p>

            <p><i>Mainland Adoniah is inspired by the Levantine heartland of the ancient Phoenicians.</i></p>

            <p id="makar-entry"></p><p><b>Makar:</b> The capital city of Makaria. The largest and most populous city in Kassatím, Makar lies in the southern Twin Rivers, its foundations set upon the banks of the Ebrina. To many, Makar is the cultural, political, and scientific center of the world. At its heart resides the Nerigal Complex: twelve ancient ziggurats, each serenely suspended 50 feet in the air by Ark-derived gravitic anchors. </p>

            <i>Makar is inspired by the ancient city of Babylon.</i>

            <p id="makaria-entry"></p><p><b>Makaria/Makarians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Revered as the cradle of civilization, Makaria's alluvial plains birthed agriculture, monumental construction, and writing, including the once pervasive crestform script. Consequently, it holds an unparalleled cultural prestige, with its capital, Makar, historically setting innumerable literary, artistic, and sartorial trends. Makaria's enormous, city-wide festivals attract visitors from across Kassatím, while its pioneering astronomers lay the groundwork for future space exploration initiatives.</p>

            <p><i>Makaria and the Makarians are inspired by Babylonia and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="netush-entry"></p><p><b>Netush:</b> The capital city of Netusha. Before the ascent of Netusha's pacifist king, Zet, Netush was among the most heavily fortified cities in the world. Now, its once-cyclopean walls lie dismantled to the east of the city, their bricks arranged neatly in the crestform sign for "peace."</p>

            <p><i>Netush is inspired by the ancient Hittite city of Hattusa. </i></p>

            <p id="netusha-entry"></p><p><b>Netusha/Netushans:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Once exceptionally militaristic and renowned for its involvement in numerous historical conflicts, including a famous clash over Qeret with Léu, it now thrives under Zet, an Ichor King (and first Ark Alien leader of a Great Kingdom) who promotes peace, piety, and measured technological advancement. Netusha operates as a theocratic absolute monarchy, with power centralized under Zet and the priesthoods of Netusha. Its capital is Netush, located at the southern reaches of the Zulpaharunna Sea.</p>

            <p><i>Netusha and the Netushans are inspired by Hatti and the ancient Hittites. </i></p>

            <p id="qeret-entry"></p><p><b>Qeret/Qereti:</b> A sprawling and cosmopolitan city of the Cerulean, Qeret encompasses the Qereti Isles that lie along the western littoral of the Adonian Mainland. Renowned for its prosperity and dominant trade networks, it serves as a crucial nexus for commerce between the Great Kingdoms. Though a vassal of Combassyia, the Qereti people maintain a distinct Adonian cultural identity. And despite periodic attempts by Combassyia to tighten its grip, Qeret’s naval strength and economic significance afford it a certain degree of autonomy.</p>

            <p><i>Qeret is inspired by the ancient Phoenician city of Tyre.</i></p>

            <p id="qereti-isle-greater-entry"></p><p><b>Qereti Isle, Greater:</b> The northward island of the Qereti Isles. The vast majority of Qeret’s population and infrastructure resides here. </p>

            <p id="qereti-isle-lesser-entry"></p><p><b>Qereti Isle, Lesser:</b> The southward island of the Qereti Isles. Its primary point of interest is the Grand Temple of Nasiru, though it is also home to numerous attendant structures.</p>

            <p id="qereti-strait-entry"></p><p><b>Qereti Strait:</b> A narrow channel separating the Qereti Isles from the Bamati Plains of Mainland Adoniah. Its waters serve as a vital artery for trade and travel, linking Qeret with the broader markets of Adoniah, Makaria, and Combassyia. Frequently patrolled by Admiralty ships, the strait’s calm waters serve as commercial hub and strategic chokepoint.</p>

            <p id="taath-entry"></p><p><b>Taath:</b> The illustrious daughter city of Qeret, Taath holds the distinction of being the first Adonian colony. Though politically aligned with Léu, it maintains an intense, occasionally volatile bond with Qeret. It has been ruled for centuries by the long-lived and beloved Queen Yilta, who is venerated as a living goddess.</p>

            <p id="ybaala-entry"></p><p><b>Ybaala:</b> A city of Colonial Adoniah, Ybaala is the daughter city of Erutu and has risen to prominence through its strategic location near Drys and Netusha, enabling it to dominate the northern Cerulean trade routes. The city’s commercial alliance with Netusha, solidified through Zet’s Compact, ensures a steady flow of metallurgical and luxury goods, heightening tensions with its perennial Adonian rival, Taath. Ybaala is also famed for the prestigious Tekronite Library, which hosts some of the world’s greatest minds.</p>

            <p><u>Sector:</u> N/A<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Hidden beneath the island of Qeret lies a vast network of caverns. Though originally formed by natural geological processes, much of the system has been expanded and rendered navigable through the strategic use of Ark technology, including the burrowing of halls and purging of floodwaters. Today, the caverns serve as a shadow city beneath the city, where clandestine factions such as the Unfettered, the Pirate League, and the Puissant maintain secret strongholds. Though many of the Caverns' highest levels are mapped, it is said that something monstrous nests in its deepest reaches, beyond the limits of any known chart.</p>
        
            <p id="grandtempleofnasiru-entry"></p><p><b>Grand Temple of Nasiru</b></p>

            <u>Description:</u> A medical facility operated by doctor-priests (mostly ichor) that worship Kelqart, Adonian god of healing and wind. They employ Dust to provide antisenescence, renewal, and resurrection treatments to the public.</p>

Under the permissive guidance of senior researcher Nadaba, it serves as a center of bold experimentation.</p>

        <section id="npcs"></section>
            <h2>NPCs</h2>
            <h3><u>Major</u></h3>

            <p id="dourhermenes-entry"></p><p><b>Dour Hermenes</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Human<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A stern counselor and one of King Tiraal's closest confidants, Hermenes is known throughout Qeret for his cold and taciturn demeanor. Beneath this forbidding exterior lies a deeply principled man, whose quiet interventions have spared countless lives from the harsher policies favored by his rival, the Impireesh Marble. Once a ruthless Wanax (city-king) of Tylos, infamous even among the bellicose Dryic, Hermenes was overthrown for his cruelty. He has since reformed and dedicated himself to temperance, moderation, and the preservation of civic life.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> To safeguard Qeret from tyranny and internal collapse by appealing to the King’s better nature and tempering his rule with caution and magnanimity. While he seeks redemption for the excesses of his past, some worry that rising tensions with the Marble might provoke a return to such excesses. </p>

            <p id="impireeshmarble-entry"></p><p><b>Impireesh Marble</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Impireesh Marble (Qeret)<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A glass-like marble that (supposedly) houses an entire microscopic alien civilization. A singular authoritative voice issues from the marble claiming to be a representative of its people. The Marble is somewhat translucent, though faint cloud-like swirls of white can be made out in its interior.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Known for its draconian counsel, it emphasizes order over compassion, often encouraging King Tiraal to rule through fear. Its true intentions remain a subject of widespread speculation and conspiracy.</p>

            <p id="izabel-entry"></p><p><b>Izabel</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Human<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Izabel's Rapture; Unfettered<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Master orator and the sole leader of Izabel's Rapture. Known for her striking beauty, Izabel sports cropped dark hair, a deliberate departure from the popular Qereti style and a symbol of her defiance. She adopts an austere lifestyle, wearing only a rough tunic and plain linen pants. Izabel appears as a 20-year-old woman, though whether that is her true age, or she has received treatments at the Resurrection Temple, is unknown.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Izabel wishes to see slavery abolished in Qeret and the rest of Kassatím. Though she preaches peaceful resistance, she also secretly abets the Unfettered and their sometimes-violent methods.</p>

            <p id="kingtiraal-entry"></p><p><b>King Tiraal (the Magnanimous)</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Human<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A 200-year-old man, who roughly appears to be the age of 40. He is a balding, handsome man and has a trimmed brown beard. Highly intelligent, charismatic, and wildly articulate, though known for his indecisiveness and diplomatic timidity. Not to be underestimated.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> To maintain an equilibrium of peace and economic prosperity. The King is torn between a dizzying assortment of conflicting alliances and loyalties. Whether it be his Combassyian overlord, Banipahl Byzes, or the aristocrats of his own city, Tiraal must always answer to somebody. He is also an avid patron of the arts, often playing host to one artist or another he picked up from the Bottega. Dryic-style holoplays are a favorite of both his and the queen’s.</p>

            <p id="queenmeshmoon-entry"></p><p><b>Queen Meshmoon</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Human<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court; Unfettered<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Queen Meshmoon is an expert (if reluctant) politician and a devoted wife. Despite her outward disdain for politics, the King frequently seeks her counsel, relying heavily on her always keen insight and tact.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Queen Meshmoon secretly supports the Unfettered and subtly works to undermine her husband’s rule. Yet, her love for him endures. She dreams of a peaceful dissolution of the monarchy, free of bloodshed.</p>

            <h3><u>Minor</u></h3>

            <p id="astarta-entry"></p><p><b>Astarta</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Macroform<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Trader's Guild<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Astarta is a book merchant and Trader's Guild functionary, best known for her exuberant haggling, her unsettling habit of mirroring customers' mannerisms, and her peculiar collection of satirical treatises, false histories, and inaccurate maps. Her shop, "The Errant Sign," tucked within the market lanes of Tekron's Custom, is a labyrinth of errata, misdirections, and lies. Though she presents herself as a harmless eccentric, Astarta is an astute economic thinker, advocating fiercely for modernization within the Guild, namely by endorsing the proposed railway project.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Within the Trader's Guild, Astarta champions the railway project not merely to modernize trade, but to cultivate stronger ties with Léu and Knakros — regions whose ancient libraries and robust scholarly communities she hopes to access more freely.</p>
            
            <p id="beirut-entry"></p><p><b>Beirut</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Macroform<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> The Seditionists<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Beirut is a silver-hued orator and confidante to Nikkal, prized for his gift in cultivating alliances and securing resources with quiet, deliberate efficiency. Within the Seditionists, Beirut acts less as a public agitator and more as an unseen architect of logistics and intrigue, ensuring that arms, coin, and loyalties move when and where they are needed. His form often shimmers with restless nanite eddies when delivering backroom speeches regarding the indignities of Combassyian rule.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Beirut seeks to liberate Qeret after private probabilistic analyses convinced him that continued Combassyian rule would, with near certainty, lead to economic collapse, widespread famine, and eventual war. In opposing foreign domination, he envisions a sovereign Qeret not merely as an act of pride, but as a bulwark against catastrophe.</p>

            <p id="burgot-entry"></p><p><b>Burgot</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Kemptoran<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A controversial economist and radical reformer, Burgot is best known for his uncompromising vision of economic rationality. Drawing on obscure Kemptoran economic theory, he advocates for the total abolition of guild privilege, the deregulation of labor, the diversification of the Qereti economy, and the easing of Qeret's dependency to Combassyia. Burgot’s proposals — sweeping, and often delivered directly to the King in dry, hyperlogical proposals —have earned him admiration among some scholars and outright hostility from nearly everyone else. Though he holds no formal office, his influence in the court cannot be overstated, and many believe he is orchestrating a slow but deliberate campaign to rearticulate Qeret’s economy from first principles. No other figure in the city speaks so openly of abolishing tariffs, centralizing currency, or replacing tradition with utility. That he is still alive is a testament either to the Court’s protection — or the sheer opacity of his work.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> To elevate Qeret through pure economic logic, stripping away custom in pursuit of a system governed only by necessity and reason. Privately, Burgot wishes to establish a parliamentary aristocracy in Qeret, not unlike the present system in Makaria.</p>

            <p id="dryad-entry"></p><p><b>Dryad</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Cordepede<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Unfettered<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Dryad masquerades as a drunk, a guise that conceals his true role as an agitator sowing dissent among the cordepede community. He also serves as an Unfettered contact, typically initiating and organizing new adherents to the cause. For security reasons, he forgoes the use of a translating servitor, insisting that new recruits acquire the glove and goggles and master the gas-script of the cordepedes to communicate.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Dryad is driven by a singular vision — transforming Qeret into a city where cordepedes can thrive and stand as equals among its citizens. Convinced that only a direct democracy can enfranchise the cordepedes, he perceives the monarchy as an obstacle that must be dismantled, no matter the cost.</p>
            
            <p id="hamil-entry"></p><p><b>Hamil</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Asectish<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> The Seditionists<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A taciturn, urban asectish who intimidates, threatens, and batters opponents of the movement. Nikkal relies on Hamil to deliver messages when bribes fail. Often sent to carry out the most destructive objectives, it was Hamil who personally devastated the Combassyian Embassy using a stolen particle hammer.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Hamil intends to stage a coup within the Seditionists' coup. If the Seditionists manage to dethrone Tiraal, Hamil plans to seize the throne for himself, even if it means eliminating his comrades.</p>

            <p id="komupid-entry"></p><p><b>Komupid</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Ichor<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Ark Sodality; Institute<br>
            <u>Description:</u> An ascetic and slightly deranged Ichor who serves as the ichorian representative on the Sodality. He is also an instructor of mathematics at the Institute. His classes often drift into highly esoteric mysticism, as he attributes spiritual significance to numbers, theorems, and ratios. He earned a seat on the Sodality through sheer popularity, having attracted an almost cult-like following, consisting primarily of students.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> He is a vegetarian (despite the fact that ichor do not consume food) and encourages his followers to adopt the same practice. Komupid’s current obsession is something he calls "the Symmetry of Thought," a theory proposing that  ideas move through the mind in mathematically structured cycles, much like celestial bodies. As such, he spends much of his time in quiet contemplation, tracking and calculating the perceived fractalized, elliptical movements of his thoughts.</p>

            <p id="maal-entry"></p><p><b>Maal</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Acumine<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Ark Sodality<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A devious acumine who is one strike away from being expelled from The Sodality. Suspected (falsely) of being a Puissant spy.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Maal seeks to subtlety undermine the work of his fellow Sodality members. Further, he hopes that by ingratiating himself with the right powers in Qeret he may seize total control of the Sodality.</p>

            <p id="odom-entry"></p><p><b>Odom</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Cordepede<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Ark Sodality<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A taciturn cordepede representing his species' interests within the Ark Sodality. He attends every Sodality meeting alongside his translating servitor, Gaavi, who faithfully relays each word of the proceedings. Though typically subdued, when stirred to action, Odom commands the floor with formidable oratory.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Odom's foremost goal is securing prosperity and equity for the cordepedes. Odom is an ardent monarchist and staunch traditionalist and believes that meaningful change can only be achieved through patience and by appealing to the better nature of the King and his subjects.</p>

            <p id="qarn-entry"></p><p><b>Qarn</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Promethean<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Pirate League<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A gregarious and ever-curious Promethean, Qarn is a fixture of the Pirate League’s expeditions across the Cerulean. Beneath the pretense of piracy, he pursues his true ambition: locating the legendary Universal Bauble (see Searchers of the Lost Bauble). His bulbous form, dyed a faded mariner’s blue, is often seen bobbing about Qeret’s docks, searching discarded crates and abandoned vessels with tireless enthusiasm.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> To find the Universal Bauble and restore the fractured fabric of reality. Though a loyal member of the League, Qarn views piracy less as a livelihood than as a necessary means of traveling, searching, and uncovering lost relics that might lead him closer to his elusive prize.</p>

            <p id="riggart-entry"></p><p><b>Riggart</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Asectish<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> The Puissant; Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> An urban asectish with sharpened exoskeleton ridges, Riggart is Master Probity’s top assassin. Like most asectish, she is laconic. However, she does indulge in broodtea and can sometimes be found in local Qereti tea rooms — usually after a kill.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Riggart is, in truth, an operative of the Impireesh Marble, and half of her missions are carried out on its behalf. She is unaware that Master Probity has uncovered her duplicity.</p>

            <p id="shemen-entry"></p><p><b>Shemen</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Kemptoran<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Admiralty<br>
            <u>Description:</u> An affable, yet fastidious bureaucrat tasked with overseeing the daily administration of the Admiralty. Though devoid of martial inclination, Shemen’s talent for ledgers, scheduling, and procedural enforcement makes him indispensable to Admiral Gal’s logistical apparatus. He has no particular interest in justice, warfare, or punishment, but maintains an unshakable commitment to order and stability. Pirates, in his view, are more than criminals — they are existential disruptors of civic routine. Their greatest offense, he often notes, is not theft, but impropriety.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> To preserve the Admiralty’s bureaucratic efficiency and ensure that Qeret’s trade networks function without disruption or indecorum. Privately, Shemen harbors grander ambitions: he hopes his reputation for administrative excellence might one day earn him a coveted court appointment in the rival city of Taath, where order is prized as highly as loyalty.</p>

            <p id="sult-entry"></p><p><b>Sult</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Vytrim<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Ark Sodality; Institute<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Sult is a renowned linguistic philosopher at the Institute and also serves on the Ark Sodality council. Sult's teachings are an intricate synthesis of dialogism and existential phenomenology. Drawing from a belief that meaning is not fixed but constantly negotiated through discourse, Sult argues that perceived reality itself is co-constructed by the subject and the object in an ongoing dialogue. His fractal brain, pulsing with faint blue light, is a common presence in the libraries of the Institute, where he researches the thresholds between perception and being. His lectures — dense, methodical, and oft maddeningly recursive — aim to dissolve the boundaries between self and other, between observer and observed. Sult's writings have made him an intellectual celebrity of the city and, indeed, wider Kassatím. <br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Sult is driven by a passion for research, the fostering of a collaborative relationship between the Sodality and the Institute, and an indulgence in his intellectual celebrity. His status has granted him influence, and he takes pleasure in the visibility his work provides. Despite these distractions, Sult remains pragmatically committed to using the Sodality to maintain the stability of Qeret's academic culture.</p>

            <p id="tanibaal-entry"></p><p><b>Tanibaal</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Promethean<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Ark Sodality; Unfettered<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A jovial and disarming figure within the Ark Sodality who secured his influence among the Promethean community through goodwill, generous patronage, and by hosting bi-monthly orgies. Tanibaal conceals his subversive ideals behind bouts of raucous laughter and conspicuous drinking. While most regard him as a harmless (if a bit lecherous) drunk, he is a committed member of the Unfettered, working quietly to undermine the Sodality’s influence over the Institute. His lumpy skin, stained with splashes of errant violet beer, and his clumsy wobbling gait make him a familiar, if underestimated, presence in the Ark Sector.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Tanibaal seeks to discretely dismantle hierarchical structures wherever he finds them, believing that institutions like the Sodality, however benevolent they appear, inevitably corrupt creative and intellectual freedom. His allegiance to the Unfettered stems from a desire to see a Qeret where knowledge, innovation, and art flourish without interference or control.</p>

            <p id="tizdor-entry"></p><p><b>Tizdor</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Vytrim<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Tizdor serves as one of the Qereti Court’s official scientists, known for his brash demeanor, monosyllabic exchanges, and general contempt for the idle aristocracy. A product of the Institute’s most demanding programs, Tizdor is a brilliant if impatient intellect who prefers the company of his fellow court scientist, Gill, over any other. His crystal brain, often flickering with restless blue light, reflects a mind perpetually agitated by the inefficiencies and pretensions of court life.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Tizdor seeks to advance scientific inquiry within the Qereti Court, though his disdain for politics and courtly decorum often undercuts his influence. He dreams of a Qeret guided by reason rather than sycophancy but begrudgingly endures his appointment as the price of influence.</p>

            <p id="trys-entry"></p><p><b>Trys</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Promethean<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Bottega<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A small, knobby-skinned promethean with sallow skin dyed Qereti violet, Trys is the wealthiest and most influential patron within the Bottega. Once a famed director of holoplays, her melodramatic tragedies fell out of fashion decades ago, but the fortune they earned endures. She is often seen ambling through the artist commune, her viscous brain bubble swaying as she dispenses advice, critiques, and patronage with an unhurried, regal air. Despite her waning of popularity, she remains a well-respected scion of the arts and her endorsement can transform a struggling artist into a citywide sensation.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Trys seeks to preserve the Bottega as a sanctuary for radical art and free expression, resisting outside pressures and commercial encroachment. Beneath her placid exterior, she grows increasingly willing to take bold measures to protect the commune’s integrity.</p>

            <p id="utica-entry"></p><p><b>Utica</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Ichor<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Priests of Nasiru<br>
            <u>Description:</u> An exceptionally charismatic figure, she works tirelessly to enhance the public perception of the Priesthood and instill greater piety in the community. As the highest representative of the Priesthood, she is always adorned in the finest liturgical vestments, including a stole of Léusian silk.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Though Utica outwardly maintains a calm and affable demeanor, she grows increasingly anxious from her responsibilities and concerns regarding the Priesthood's future. Driven by desperation, she has begun contemplating increasingly risky (and illegal) actions to secure the future of the Grand Temple and the Priesthood. </p>

            <p id="zygothewag-entry"></p><p><b>Zygo the Wag</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Acumine<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> An acumine resident of the Royal Palace, Zygo has secured his position in the Qereti Court through sharp wit and undeniable charm. The King delights in his biting barbs and the subtle political satires woven into his entertaining stories. Zygo always dons the latest Qereti fashions, albeit deliberately shredded — perhaps envisioning himself a tattered reflection of the culture he inhabits. His chief rival at court is Kelqart the Importunate, a beloved singer-poet.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Zygo lives for simple pleasures. He revels in his station at court and will stop at nothing to preserve it. However, behind closed doors, he indulges in procuring and torturing slaves — a pastime that, if exposed, could lead to disgrace and his swift ejection from the palace.</p>

            <u>Description:</u> Violent, non-sentient biological automatons, the unrooted emerge from the ocean to slaughter humans and pilfer technology, operating as extensions of the Rooted One’s flesh and will. Their grotesquely asymmetrical forms consume prey whole while preserving material goods to return to the Rooted One. The unrooted are relentless tools of destruction, incapable of communication or understanding motives beyond their master’s drive for the eradication of all other lifeforms.<br>
            <u>Origin:</u> The last of its species, the Rooted One exterminated its kin in a brutal evolutionary conflict.
