            <p id="kassatím"></p><p><b>Kassatím</b>: The known world. Once inhabited solely by humans, it is now shared with Ark Aliens. It includes six great kingdoms — Knakros, Léu, Drys, Netusha, Makaria, and Combassyia — alongside the ten city-states of Adoniah.</p>

            <p id="knakros-entry"></p><p><b>Knakros/The Knakriti:</b> One of Kassatím's six great kingdoms. Knakros is an archipelago, located just north of Léu, inhabited by the Knakriti people. Though renowned for their immense navy, they are a peaceful people. The Ark landed on Dactos, a Knakriti isle, making them the first to encounter Ark Aliens. Knakriti society has since embraced Ark technologies and customs more than any other culture of the world.</p>

            <p><i>Knakros and the Knakriti are inspired by Ancient Crete and the Minoan civilization.</i></p>

            <p id="leu-entry"></p><p><b>Léu/Léusians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Léu is both a nation and a continent located on the southern Cerulean. It is a prosperous powerhouse of both technology and culture and is renowned for its monumental pyramids of Ixia and vibrant cities like Lux. The Léusians operate under a digital direct democracy and the kingdom’s egalitarian ethos attracts many immigrants to its shores. The Léusians thrive on exports of wheat, gold, stone, and Ark tech. It rivals Makaria and Combassyia in both age and influence but has abandoned its former militaristic ambitions since the Ark’s arrival.</p>

            <p><i>Léu and the Léusians are inspired by Ancient Egypt and its peoples.</i></p>
