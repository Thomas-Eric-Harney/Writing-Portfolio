            <h2>Geography/People</h2>

            <p id="adoniah-entry"></p><p><b>Adoniah:</b> A disunified network of coastal city-states, known for its merchant culture and naval prowess. Adonians share customs, language, and a religious pantheon despite political fragmentation. Adoniah divides into Mainland Adoniah and Colonial Adoniah. Mainland Adoniah consists of the original five city-states along the Twin Rivers littoral, while Colonial Adoniah encompasses their respective overseas colonies.</p>

            <p><i>Adoniah and the Adonians are inspired by Ancient Phoenicia and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="cerulean-entry"></p><p><b>Cerulean Sea:</b> A vast, central body of water in Kassatím, linking the eastern Great Kingdoms of Combassyia, Makaria, and Netusha with the western Great Kingdoms of Léu, Knakros, and Drys.</p>
           
            <p id="combassyia-entry"></p><p><b>Combassyia/Combassyians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Combassyia is a militaristic society led by the despotic God-King Banipahl Byzes, who rules from the capital of Scintevah. Renowned for its powerful standing armies, Combassyia commands the northern Twin-Rivers region from the coast to the Akroz Mountains. While striving to rival Makaria’s cultural achievements, it also enforces a Pre-Ark societal structure where religion underpins state power. The Cult of Sarkosh, the kingdom’s patron deity, serves as a central pillar of Combassyian society, influencing governance, conquest, and daily life. The Adonian Mainland, including Qeret, is currently under Combassyian control.</p>

            <i>Combassyia and the Combassyians are inspired by Ancient Assyria and its peoples.</i>

            <p id="dactos-entry"></p><p><b>Dactos:</b> A Knakriti isle where the Ark landed in 1 A.A., now home only to scientists, scholars, and reclusive eccentrics.</p>

            <p id="drys-entry"></p><p><b>Drys/Dryics:</b> One of Kassatím's six great kingdoms. Drys, pronounced "<i>driss</i>," is renowned for its warlike culture and maritime prowess. Positioned on a vast peninsula and encompassing an extensive archipelago, Drys is ruled by a warlord from its capital, Drycenaea. Though disjointed, its belligerent demeanor has secured its Great Kingdom status. Recently, Drys has experienced a philosophical renaissance, fostering some of humanity's most advanced scientific minds, contrasting its reputation for fractious squabbling and piracy.</p>

            <p><i>Drys and the Dryics are inspired by Ancient Mycenaean Greece and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="ixia-entry"></p><p><b>Ixia:</b> A small Léusian town to the west of the capital city, Lux, across the Zanhir River. Notably, it is the site of the five Great Pyramids of Ixia, constructed in millennia past as elaborate tombs for ancient kings of Léu known as the Nesurai. Now, the pyramids serve a different function. The marbles, once encased in marble, have now been augmented with Ark-derived computer systems specifically designed to maintain the digital system of direct democracy that the modern Léusian system now operates by.</p>

            <p><i>Ixia is inspired by the Ancient Egyptian settlement of Giza.</i></p>

            <p id="kassatim-entry"></p><p><b>Kassatím:</b> The known world. Once inhabited solely by humans, it is now shared with Ark Aliens. It includes six great kingdoms — Knakros, Léu, Drys, Netusha, Makaria, and Combassyia — alongside the ten city-states of Adoniah.</p>

            <p><i>Kassatím is inspired by the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean societies of the Bronze Age.</i></p>

            <p id="knakros-entry"></p><p><b>Knakros/Knakriti:</b> One of Kassatím's six great kingdoms. Knakros is an archipelago, located just north of Léu, inhabited by the Knakriti people. Though renowned for their immense navy, they are a peaceful people. The Ark landed on Dactos, a Knakriti isle, making them the first to encounter Ark Aliens. Knakriti society has since embraced Ark technologies and customs more than any other culture of the world. The majority of the Knakriti population reside in the capital city of Taur. </p>

            <p><i>Knakros and the Knakriti are inspired by Ancient Crete and the Minoans.</i></p>

            <p id="leu-entry"></p><p><b>Léu/Léusians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Léu is both a nation and a continent located on the southern Cerulean. It is a prosperous powerhouse of both technology and culture and is renowned for its monumental pyramids of Ixia and vibrant cities like its capital, Lux. The Léusians operate under a digital direct democracy and the kingdom’s egalitarian ethos attracts many immigrants to its shores. The Léusians thrive on exports of wheat, gold, stone, and Ark tech. It rivals Makaria and Combassyia in both age and influence but has abandoned its former militaristic ambitions since the Ark’s arrival.</p>

            <p><i>Léu and the Léusians are inspired by Ancient Egypt and its peoples.</i></p>

            <p id="lux-entry"></p><p><b>Lux:</b> The current capital of Léu. It lies along the eastern banks of the Ankh River in Lower Léu. It is among the longest continuously habituated cities in the world.</p>

            <i>Lux is inspired by the Ancient Egyptian city of Memphis.</i>

            <p id="makaria-entry"></p><p><b>Makaria/Makarians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Revered as the cradle of civilization, Makaria's alluvial plains birthed agriculture, monumental construction, and writing, including the once pervasive crestform script. Consequently, it holds an unparalleled cultural prestige, with its capital, Makar, historically setting innumerable literary, artistic, and sartorial trends. Makaria's enormous, city-wide festivals attract visitors from across Kassatím, while its pioneering astronomers lay the groundwork for future space exploration initiatives.</p>

            <i>Makaria and the Makarians are inspired by Babylonia and its peoples.</i>

            <p id="netusha-entry"></p><p><b>Netusha/Netushans:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Once exceptionally militaristic and renowned for its involvement in numerous historical conflicts, including a famous clash over Qeret with Léu, it now thrives under Zet, an Ichor King (and first Ark Alien leader of a Great Kingdom) who promotes peace, piety, and measured technological advancement. Netusha operates as a theocratic absolute monarchy, with power centralized under Zet and the priesthoods of Netusha. Its capital is Netush, located at the southern reaches of the Zulpaharunna Sea. </p>

            <p><i>Netusha and the Netushans are inspired by Hatti and the ancient Hittites. </i></p>

            <p id="taath-entry"></p><p><b>Taath:</b> A city of Colonial Adoniah. It is the daughter city of Qeret and lies on the northwestern coast of Léu. It has been ruled by Queen Yilta for over three centuries. </p>

            <p><i>Taath is inspired by the Ancient Phoenician city of Carthage.</i></p>

            <p id="twinrivers-entry"></p><p><b>Twin Rivers:</b> Shaped by the Ebrina and Zarash rivers, this region lies between the Akroz Mountains to the east and Mainland Adoniah to the west. Combassyia controls the north and Makaria the south.</p>

            <i>The Twin Rivers region is inspired by Ancient Mesopotamia.</i>

The Marble is somewhat translucent, though faint cloud-like swirls of white can be made out in its interior.<br>
            <u>Motivation:</u> Known for its draconian counsel, it emphasizes order over compassion, often encouraging King Tiraal to rule through fear. Its true intentions remain a subject of widespread speculation and conspiracy.</p>

            <u>Motivation:</u> To maintain an equilibrium of peace and economic prosperity. The King is torn between a dizzying assortment of conflicting alliances and loyalties. Whether it be his Combassyian overlord, Banipahl Byzes, or the aristocrats of his own city, Tiraal must always answer to somebody. He is also an avid patron of the arts, often playing host to one artist or another he picked up from the Bottega. Dryic-style holoplays are a favorite of both his and the queen’s.</p>
