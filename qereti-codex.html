Combassyia is a militaristic society led by the despotic God-King Banipahl Byzes, who rules from the capital of Scintevah. Renowned for its powerful standing armies, Combassyia commands the northern Twin-Rivers region from the coast to the Akroz Mountains. While striving to rival Makaria’s cultural achievements, it also enforces a Pre-Ark societal structure where religion underpins state power. The Cult of Sarkosh, the kingdom’s patron deity, serves as a central pillar of Combassyian society, influencing governance, conquest, and daily life. The Adonian Mainland, including Qeret, is currently under Combassyian control.</p>

            <p><i>Combassyia and the Combassyians are inspired by Ancient Assyria and its peoples.</i></p>

The marbles, once encased in marble, have now been augmented with Ark-derived computer systems specifically designed to maintain the digital system of direct democracy that the modern Léusian system now operates by.</p>

            <p><i>Ixia is inspired by the Ancient Egyptian settlement of Giza.</i></p>

            <p id="knakros-entry"></p><p><b>Knakros/Knakriti:</b> One of Kassatím's six great kingdoms. Knakros is an archipelago, located just north of Léu, inhabited by the Knakriti people. Though renowned for their immense navy, they are a peaceful people. The Ark landed on Dactos, a Knakriti isle, making them the first to encounter Ark Aliens. Knakriti society has since embraced Ark technologies and customs more than any other culture of the world. The majority of the Knakriti population reside in the capital city of Taur. </p>

            <i>Mainland Adoniah is inspired by the Levantine heartland of the ancient Phoenicians.</i>

            <p id="makaria-entry"></p><p><b>Makaria/Makarians:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Revered as the cradle of civilization, Makaria's alluvial plains birthed agriculture, monumental construction, and writing, including the once pervasive crestform script. Consequently, it holds an unparalleled cultural prestige, with its capital, Makar, historically setting innumerable literary, artistic, and sartorial trends. Makaria's enormous, city-wide festivals attract visitors from across Kassatím, while its pioneering astronomers lay the groundwork for future space exploration initiatives.</p>

            <i>Makaria and the Makarians are inspired by Babylonia and its peoples.</i>

            <p id="netusha-entry"></p><p><b>Netusha/Netushans:</b> One of Kassatím’s six great kingdoms. Once exceptionally militaristic and renowned for its involvement in numerous historical conflicts, including a famous clash over Qeret with Léu, it now thrives under Zet, an Ichor King (and first Ark Alien leader of a Great Kingdom) who promotes peace, piety, and measured technological advancement. Netusha operates as a theocratic absolute monarchy, with power centralized under Zet and the priesthoods of Netusha. Its capital is Netush, located at the southern reaches of the Zulpaharunna Sea. </p>

            <p><i>Netusha and the Netushans are inspired by Hatti and the ancient Hittites. </i></p>

            <u>Description:</u> Master orator and the sole leader of Izabel's Rapture.

            <p id="maal-entry"></p><p><b>Maal</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Acumine<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Ark Sodality<br>
            <u>Description:</u> A devious acumine who is one strike away from being expelled from The Sodality. Suspected (falsely) of being a Puissant spy.<br>
            <u>Motication:</u> Maal seeks to subtlety undermine the work of his fellow Sodality members. Further, he hopes that by ingratiating himself with the right powers in Qeret he may seize total control of the Sodality.</p>

            <p id="zygothewag-entry"></p><p><b>Zygo the Wag</b></p>
            <p><u>Species:</u> Acumine<br>
            <u>Faction:</u> Qereti Court<br>
            <u>Description:</u> An acumine resident of the Royal Palace, Zygo has secured his position in the Qereti Court through sharp wit and undeniable charm. The King delights in his biting barbs and the subtle political satires woven into his entertaining stories. Zygo always dons the latest Qereti fashions, albeit deliberately shredded — perhaps envisioning himself a tattered reflection of the culture he inhabits. His chief rival at court is Kelqart the Importunate, a beloved singer-poet.<br>
            <u>Motication:</u> Zygo lives for simple pleasures. He revels in his station at court and will stop at nothing to preserve it. However, behind closed doors, he indulges in procuring and torturing slaves — a pastime that, if exposed, could lead to his disgrace and ejection from the palace.</p>

They are driven by an innate desire to build, whether it be grand edifices, ships, monuments, etc. Communicating with cordepedes requires the use of specialized devices known as "the glove and goggles." Due to this language barrier, they live as second-class citizens.<br>
            <u>Origin:</u> Cordepedes originated on Cockaigne, a life-bearing moon where they were bred by their creators as part of a vast experimental gardens. Unique in their drive to build, they constructed monumental architecture before an interstellar parasitic vine nearly destroyed them, prompting their rescue by the Ark.</p>

            <u>Origin:</u> According to the Marbles, their tiny inhabitants are a microscopic race that once thrived in the superfluid mantle of a neutron star called Galthax.

            <p><u>Class:</u> Ark Alien<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Violent, non-sentient biological automatons, the unrooted emerge from the ocean to slaughter humans and pilfer technology, operating as extensions of the Rooted One’s flesh and will. Their grotesquely asymmetrical forms consume prey whole while preserving material goods to return to the Rooted One. The unrooted are relentless tools of destruction, incapable of communication or understanding motives beyond their master’s drive for the eradication of all other lifeforms.<br>
            <u>Origin:</u> The last of its species, the Rooted One exterminated its kin in a brutal evolutionary conflict. Rescued from extinction by the Ark, it later escaped imprisonment after the vessel arrived on Kassatím.

            <p><u>Class:</u> Ark Alien<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Tripedal Ark aliens with gray fur and a glowing crystalline brain, vytrim rely on photosynthesis for energy and emit vibratory frequencies to communicate. They are insatiable scholars and innovators, pivotal in making Ark technology accessible to humanity.
