        <h2>The World-Home</h2>
        <p>
          Qeret is among the most cosmopolitan cities in the known world.
          Traders from across
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#kassatim-entry">Kassatím</a></strong> can be
          found peddling their wares in
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#nonagon-entry">the Nonagon</a></strong
          >;
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#makaria-entry">Makarian</a></strong> cultists
          often proselytize before the
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#grandtempleofnasiru-entry"
              >Grand Temple of Nasiru</a
            ></strong
          >; and
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#kemptoran-entry">kemptoran</a></i>
          tourists from
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#leu-entry">Léu</a></strong> drink heartily in
          the <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#bachnal-entry">bachnals</a></i> of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#eliunsshame-entry">Eliun’s Shame</a></strong
          >. It is estimated that a fifth of the Qereti population hails from
          abroad. For this reason, the Qereti often refer to their city as the
          "World-Home.” Ark aliens, too, have been fully integrated into the
          city’s culture and neighborhoods, though a certain degree of
          segregation persists.<sup
            ><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text">1</a></sup
          >
          In the current year, 284 A.A., Qeret is home to roughly one million
          inhabitants, and on any given day there about 50,000 tourists in the
          city.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Qereti are an active people. When walking through the streets one
          sees colorful bustling crowds, massive construction projects, and
          countless merchant stalls peddling everything from the cheapest wines
          to the finest dresswear embroidered with illuminant
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#skein-entry">skeins</a></i
          >. Further, abundant food and a general prosperity have freed the time
          of the Qereti. Many have the luxury to occupy their time with artistic
          pursuits — such as performance, painting, and music — once limited to
          specialist artisans. Now, freewheeling artist-types are exceedingly
          common in Qeret, often seen singing and cavorting in the streets.

        <h2>The Monarchy & Combassyia</h2>
        <p>
          Qeret is a monarchy ruled by
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#kingtiraal-entry"
              >King Tiraal the Magnanimous</a
            ></strong
          >
          and his wife,
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#queenmeshmoon-entry"
              >Queen Meshmoon</a
            ></strong
          >. But, though they carry much authority in their city, ultimately
          Qeret is a vassal beholden to
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#combassyia-entry">Combassyia</a></strong> and
          its Emperor,
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#banipahlbyzes-entry"
              >Banipahl Byzes</a
            ></strong
          >. In the past, Qeret has been a vassal to other great kingdoms such
          as Léu and Makaria, both with whom Qeret still shares amiable
          diplomatic relations. The taxes and annual tributes that Combassyia
          collects are sizeable, leading many of the Qereti (especially of the
          merchant class) to resent the city’s vassal status. Indeed, a
          liberatory insurgency faction known as
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#theseditionists-entry"
              >the Seditionists</a
            ></strong
          >
          has taken root in the upper classes.

        <h2>Colors of Qeret</h2>
        <p>
          In Qeret, the prevailing colors are violet, blue and crimson, with
          violet being a color favored by wider
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#adoniah-entry">Adoniah</a></strong
          >, blue signifying the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#cerulean-entry">Cerulean</a></strong> and
          Qeret’s command of the seas, and crimson representing the red soil of
          the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#bamatiplains-entry">Bamati Plains</a></strong
          >. Most banners, buildings, and fineries display these colors to some
          degree in isolation or in combination.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Wider Adoniah</h2>
        <p>
          Qeret’s primary rival, both culturally and commercially, is the city
          of <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#erutu-entry">Erutu</a></strong
          >: an Adonian city-state 50 miles north of the island, situated along
          the coast of the northern Bamati Plains. Both claim the honor of being
          the first of the Adonian cities. In contrast, Qeret’s daughter city,
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#taath-entry">Taath</a></strong
          >, maintains very close diplomatic relations with its forebear,
          despite being a vassal to, and lying behind the borders of, the Great
          Kingdom of Léu, a perennial opponent of Qeret’s seigniory, Combassyia.
          More information regarding the other cities of Adoniah, and Qeret’s
          relationship to each, may be found in <strong>War & Diplomacy</strong>.

        <h2>Bachnals</h2>
        <p>
          For recreational drinking, communal feasting, and lodging, one might
          seek out one of the numerous
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#bachnal-entry">bachnals</a></i> of the
          city. It is often said, hyperbolically, that there are more bachnals
          than people in the city of Qeret. A wide range of such establishments
          exist in Qeret, both in terms of quality and of clientele. In
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#dagonsrespite-entry"
              >Dagon’s Respite</a
            ></strong
          >, the wealthy dally in bachnals constructed entirely of marble
          engraved with intricate skeins that illuminate their interiors with
          soft and pleasing light. Other less reputable bachnals can be found in
          sectors such as
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#nasirusblessing-entry"
              >Nasiru’s Blessing</a
            ></strong
          >
          that amount to little more than leaning shacks, catering exclusively
          to criminals, drunkards, destitute artists, and a dozen other classes
          of rabble.

        <h2>Bartery & Silver</h2>
        <p>
          There is no form of currency in Qeret, nor are any of the Ark aliens
          familiar with such a concept. Rather, there is a barter system.
          Precious metals or jewels might trade for an endless variety of
          things: barley, sex, a house, information, etc. Consequently,
          bartering is an important skill for any Qereti to have. The closest
          thing to lucre is silver: the most common non-consumable trade good.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="section-box" id="bartery">
        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>A Note on Trade</u></h3>

        <p>
          In addition to silver, players should be encouraged to acquire goods
          of a wide range in value. This is so they may, in turn, barter for a
          wide variety of goods: a religious idol lacquered in gold might easily
          trade for a two-story home in the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#slavesector-entry">Slave Sector</a></strong>
          but would be wasted on a single night spent in a brothel. It’s best to
          have goods that can be commensurately exchanged when engaging in
          trade.
        </p>

        <p>
          For GMs running games in which treasure may be spent for experience,
          in <strong>Locations</strong>, I have included the approximate value of items in
          silver so that your characters may readily gain experience from
          purchasing or trading items.

        <h2>Slavery</h2>
        <p>
          Slavery is practiced in Qeret just as it is the rest of the world
          (excluding
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#knakros-entry">Knakros</a></strong> and Léu).
          Excepting state-owned slaves that toil in mines and fields, slaves are
          commonly used for menial labor, often working as servants, deckhands,
          factory workers, etc. In most cities, however, the enslavement of Ark
          aliens is strictly forbidden, a policy dating back to the
          <strong

              >Long Century of Integration</a
            ></strong
          >. Of late, the custom has come under great scrutiny, as ethical
          considerations, made by compassionate humans and Ark aliens alike,
          have resulted in many emancipatory movements to emerge across
          Kassatím. In Qeret, the movement of

          >
          strives to free the slaves of Qeret, led by a charismatic freedwomen
          known by her followers as
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#izabel-entry">Izabel</a></strong

        <h2>Fashion</h2>
        <p>
          Qeret is renowned for its textile industry and fittingly the Qereti
          are known for their unique sense of fashion. Traditionally, common
          Qereti men dress simply with breeches, an under shirt, tan tunic, and
          a smart white mantle thrown over their shoulders. On their head they
          often sport the Adonian
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#kashenti-entry">kashenti</a></i
          >, a conical leather headdress that is topped with a knotted cord.
          Common Qereti women dress in heavy robes with draping folds covering
          the majority of their body. Their hair is usually tressed and grown
          long. During the day, most women wear an elegant loose hood over their
          head. Among the upper-classes men dress immaculately, eschewing the
          traditional tunic for ornamented robes that are limned by cosmetic
          <i>skeins</i> and a violet mantle often draped over shoulder and
          torso; finery decorated as such is a common sign of high-status.
          Affluent women dress much like their poorer counterparts but with
          finer materials and an abundance of jewelry. Miniature
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#lantern-entry">lanterns</a></i> often
          adorn their person in the form of necklaces or amulets, at appropriate
          moments projecting tasteful holograms such as a couple gracefully
          dancing or an human-kemptoran coupling, mid-coitus.

        <h2>Ark Works</h2>
        <p>
          Ornate <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#dust-entry">Dust</a></i
          >-infused tattoos known as
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#arkwork-entry">Ark works</a></strong> are
          common among all the citizens of Qeret. Ark works "surge" when needed,
          releasing dust nanites directly into the bloodstream of the individual
          and granting temporary and unique abilities. They tend to serve very
          specific purposes. A merchant may have an Ark work whose surge
          releases nanites that stimulate the parietal lobes of the brain,
          allowing them to calculate vast numerical sums in the blink of an eye.
          Or a caulker may have an Ark work whose surge delivers nanites into
          their biceps and deltoids, thus engorging their muscles and allowing
          them to carry a particularly heavy load of lumber. Though Ark work
          surges can be merely cosmetic — such as by releasing a persistent
          perfumed odor — most serve one practical purpose or another.
