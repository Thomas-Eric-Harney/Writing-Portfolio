            <h2>The World-Home</h2>
                <p>Qeret is among the most cosmopolitan cities in the known world. Traders from across <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#kassatim-entry">Kassatím</a></b> can be found peddling their wares in <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#nonagon-entry">the Nonagon</a></b>; <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#makaria-entry">Makarian</a></b> cultists often proselytize before the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#grandtempleofnasiru-entry">Grand Temple of Nasiru</a></b>; and <i>kemptoran</i> tourists from <b>Léu</b> drink heartily in the <i>bachnals</i> of <b>Eliun’s Shame</b>. It is estimated that a fifth of the Qereti population hails from abroad. For this reason, the Qereti often refer to their city as “The World-Home.” Ark aliens, too, have been fully integrated into the city’s culture and neighborhoods, though a certain degree of segregation persists.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text">1</a></sup> In the current year, 284 A.A., Qeret is home to roughly one million inhabitants, and on any given day there about 50,000 tourists in the city.</p>
        
                <p>The Qereti are an active people. When walking through the streets one sees colorful bustling crowds, massive construction projects, and countless merchant stalls peddling everything from the cheapest wines to the finest dresswear embroidered with illuminant <i>skeins</i>. Further, abundant food and a general prosperity have freed the time of the Qereti. Many have the luxury to occupy their time with artistic pursuits — such as performance, painting, and music — once limited to specialist artisans. Now, freewheeling artist-types are exceedingly common in Qeret, often seen singing and cavorting in the streets.</p>

            <h2>The Monarchy & Combassyia</h2>
                <p>Qeret is a monarchy ruled by King Tiraal the Magnanimous and his wife, <b>Queen Meshmoon</b>. But, though they carry much authority in their city, ultimately Qeret is a vassal beholden to <b>Combassyia</b> and its Emperor, <b>Banipahl Byzes</b>. In the past, Qeret has been a vassal to other great kingdoms such as Léu and Makaria, both with whom Qeret still shares amiable diplomatic relations. The taxes and annual tributes that Combassyia collects are sizeable, leading many of the Qereti (especially of the merchant class) to resent the city’s vassal status. Indeed, a liberatory insurgency faction known as <b>the Seditionists</b> has taken root in the upper classes.</p>

            <h2>Colors of Qeret</h2>
            <p>In Qeret, the prevailing colors are violet, blue and crimson, with violet being a color favored by wider <b>Adoniah</b>, blue signifying the Cerulean and Qeret’s command of the seas, and crimson representing the red soil of the <b>Bamati Plains</b>. Most banners, buildings, and fineries display these colors to some degree in isolation or in combination.</p>

            <h2>Wider Adoniah</h2>
            <p>Qeret’s primary rival, both culturally and commercially, is the city of <b>Erutu</b>: an Adonian city-state 50 miles north of the island, situated along the coast of the northern Bamati Plains. Both claim the honor of being the first of the Adonian cities. In contrast, Qeret’s daughter city, <b>Taath</b>, maintains very close diplomatic relations with its forebear, despite being a vassal to, and lying behind the borders of, the Great Kingdom of Léu, a perennial opponent of Qeret’s seigniory, Combassyia. More information regarding the other cities of Adoniah, and Qeret’s relationship to each, may be found in <b>War & Diplomacy</b>.</p>

            <h2>Bachnals</h2>
            <p>For recreational drinking, communal feasting, and lodging, one might seek out one of the numerous <i>bachnals</i> of the city. It is often said, hyperbolically, that there are more bachnals than people in the city of Qeret. A wide range of such establishments exist in Qeret, both in terms of quality and of clientele. In <b>Dagon’s Respite</b>, the wealthy dally in bachnals constructed entirely of marble engraved with intricate skeins that illuminate their interiors with soft and pleasing light. Other less reputable bachnals can be found in sectors such as <b>Nasiru’s Blessing</b> that amount to little more than leaning shacks, catering exclusively to criminals, drunkards, destitute artists, and a dozen other classes of rabble.</p>

            <h2>Bartery & Silver</h2>
                <p>There is no form of currency in Qeret, nor are any of the Ark aliens familiar with such a concept. Rather, there is a barter system. Precious metals or jewels might trade for an endless variety of things: barley, sex, a house, information, etc. Consequently, bartering is an important skill for any Qereti to have. The closest thing to lucre is silver: the most common non-consumable trade good. </p>
        </section>

            <h3 class="centered-heading">A Note on Trade</h3>

            <p>In addition to silver, players should be encouraged to acquire goods of a wide range in value. This is so they may, in turn, barter for a wide variety of goods: a religious idol lacquered in gold might easily trade for a two-story home in the <b>Slave Sector</b> but would be wasted on a single night spent in a brothel. It’s best to have goods that can be commensurately exchanged when engaging in trade. </p>
            
            <p>For GMs running games in which treasure may be spent for experience, in <b>Locations</b>, I have included the approximate value of items in silver so that your characters may readily gain experience from purchasing or trading items. </p>

            <h2>Slavery</h2>
            <p>Slavery is practiced in Qeret just as it is the rest of the world (excluding <b>Knakros</b> and Léu). Excepting state-owned slaves that toil in mines and fields, slaves are commonly used for menial labor, often working as servants, deckhands, factory workers, etc. Of late, the custom has come under great scrutiny, as ethical considerations, made by compassionate humans and Ark aliens alike, have resulted in many emancipatory movements to emerge across Kassatím. In Qeret, the movement of <b>Izabel’s Rapture</b> strives to free the slaves of Qeret, led by a charismatic freedwomen known by her followers as Izabel. </p>

            <h2>Fashion</h2>
            <p>Qeret is renowned for its textile industry and fittingly the Qereti are known for their unique sense of fashion. Traditionally, common Qereti men dress simply with breeches, an under shirt, tan tunic, and a smart white mantle thrown over their shoulders. On their head they often sport the <i>kashenti</i>, a conical shaped headdress that is topped with a knotted cord at its tip. Common Qereti women dress in heavy robes with draping folds covering the majority of their body. Their hair is usually tressed and grown long. During the day, most women wear an elegant loose hood over their head. Among the upper-classes men dress immaculately, eschewing the traditional tunic for ornamented robes that are limned by cosmetic skeins and a violet mantle often draped over shoulder and torso; finery decorated as such is a common sign of high-status. Affluent women dress much like their poorer counterparts but with finer materials and an abundance of jewelry. Miniature <i>lanterns</i> often adorn their person in the form of necklaces or amulets, at appropriate moments projecting tasteful holograms such as a couple gracefully dancing or an human-kemptoran coupling, mid-coitus. </p>

        <h2>Ark Works</h2>
        <p>Ornate <i>Dust</i>-infused tattoos known as <b>Ark works</b> are common among all the citizens of Qeret.  Ark-Works surge with energy-infused nanites when needed, releasing directly into the bloodstream of the individual and granting temporary and unique abilities. They tend to serve very specific purposes. A merchant may have an Ark work whose “surge” releases nanites that stimulate the parietal lobes of the brain, allowing them to calculate vast numerical sums in the blink of an eye. Or a caulker may have an Ark work whose surge delivers nanites into their biceps and deltoids, thus engorging their muscles and allowing them to carry a particularly heavy load of lumber. Though Ark work surges can be merely cosmetic — such as by releasing a persistent perfumed odor — most serve one purpose or another.</p>
