        <p>Before the arrival of the <strong>Ark</strong>, religion dominated cultural life in <strong>Kassatím</strong>. The gods were not perceived as distant abstractions; they directly influenced everyday life, determining social hierarchies, modes of governance, and the rhythms of labor and celebration. The people discerned divinity in nature, in war, and in the harvest, with each city upholding a patron deity who presided over its population with a mercurial balance of favor and wrath. </p>
        
        <p>Though religion now holds less sway, <strong>Adonian</strong> religious culture still revolves around a crowded pantheon of personalities, myths, and ritual obligations. Temples of fading grandeur house each god’s statue, which worshippers treat not as mere symbols but as the corporeal presence of the deities themselves. Priests guard these statues as sacred relics, maintaining them with constant vigilance and ritual care. Any attempt to damage or desecrate one constitutes grave sacrilege and may draw the severest punishments, at the discretion of its respective city. </p>
