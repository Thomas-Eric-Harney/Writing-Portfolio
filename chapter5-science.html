            <p>Ark alien innovations have profoundly altered the world of Kassatím, though these changes remain uneven. Assembling Ark alien technology often demands rare, exotic resources, which limits mass production and restricts its widespread use. Furthermore, the process typically requires specialized factories and workshops. As a result, while Ark alien technology is relatively common, it has not wholly transformed the world. Kassatím, therefore, presents a highly incongruous aspect: high-speed, <i>marásh</i>-equipped naval vessels mingle in harbors with traditional sailing ships, while edifices reinforced with advanced metallic alloys retain their pre-Ark architectural simplicity. While no food is scarce due to genetically enhanced crops, basic cereals like wheat and barley remain dietary staples. The cities are illuminated with electrical <i>skeins</i>; meanwhile, much of the countryside remains untouched by artificial light. Ark technology has revolutionized warfare, yet many human warriors still cling to their bronze swords rather than adopting <i>plasma torcs</i>. In essence, Kassatím is a stark blend of antiquity and modernity: the deeply archaic and the astonishingly advanced.</p>

            <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Humans and Science</u></h3>
                <p>In <b>Kassatím</b>, Ark alien sciences and their resultant technologies have been eagerly embraced by most cultures, including Qeret. Consequently, the sciences and their related professions have become integral to society. However, while most Ark aliens may be forthcoming regarding scientific knowledge, most humans still struggle to fully comprehend such intricate subjects. As a result, human "experts" in specialized fields frequently possess only a rudimentary grasp of the fields they study. For instance, a Qereti physicist may understand antimatter as the fundamental opposition to regular matter but would typically lack any deeper insights. Nevertheless, some human scientists are quicker to grasp such topics, often proving to their professional advantage.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Agronomy</h2>

            <p>Of all the Ark alien sciences, Advanced Agronomy has altered human civilization more than any other. Once, famine and drought provided an endless source of anxiety for any human village, city, or empire. Luckily, such whims of nature no longer threaten the world. Farmers now use <i>fertilizer pods</i> to quickly enrich the most barren tracts of land. Talented geneticists have partnered with agronomists to breed unique varieties of wheat and barley that are hardier, more nutritious, and disease resistant. Other inventions are subtler, such as the use of <i>enriched heavy water</i> that sinks deep into the fields. And yet others more noticeable, such as the massive, pivoting <i>silver reflectors</i> that provide additional sunlight onto the wheat and barley fields of the world.</p>
        
            <p>Within Qeret's Ark Sector lies <b>the Greenery</b>, a sprawling greenhouse dedicated to advanced botanical experimentation and breeding operations. Among its most popular innovations are <i>fungal orbs</i>, used by many for their narcotic properties and augmentative effects. By splicing mushrooms with traits from diverse Ark organisms — including various algae, bacteria, plants, and other exotic lifeforms — the botanists of the Greenery have engineered mushrooms capable of inducing temporary epigenetic changes in human cells upon consumption. Orbs might boost physical endurance, bolster the immune system, or heighten cognitive abilities, depending on the variety consumed. These augmentations are accompanied by vivid psychoactive effects, including euphoria, mania, or sanguinity. Each orb, roughly the size of a large bead, is designed for convenience: to induce the desired effect, one merely crushes the orb in hand and quickly inhale the scattered spores.</p>

        <h2>Ark Weaponry</h2>

        <p>War-chariots once ruled the battlefields of Kassatím, often serving as the decisive factor in military engagements. Highly mobile, quick, and devastating at range, war-chariots could end most battles conclusively or deter them altogether. With the arrival of the Ark, this paradigm of war endures, but the instruments have changed. Victory now belongs to the nation that deploys the greatest arsenal of Ark weapons to the battlefield.</p>
    
        <p>Perhaps most destructive, and most sought after, is the fell <i>particle hammer</i>. These weighty, expensive, and cumbersome devices are capable of disintegrating thousands of combatants in mere moments. When activated, these leviathans of titanium and pulsating plasma conduits release blinding shafts of beta particles woven with gamma rays. Impact from a particle hammer’s roiling violet light initiates a near-instantaneous cascade of atomic disintegration as particles burrow into molecular bonds, rending them with ease. Excluding Knakros, the accumulation of particle hammers is a top priority for the six Great Kingdoms of Kassatím. Though, despite the rising number of such devices — some estimates place the total around 10,000 — the Great Kingdoms have thus far exercised unprecedented restraint, as particle hammers have yet to be deployed in battle. Many advocates for peace across Kassatím have called for the dismantling of each and every particle hammer in existence and an inter-kingdom proscription on their use and construction.</p>

        <p>Less destructive, but equally concerning, are the diminutive devices known as <i>Pahl-drones</i>. Developed on behalf of, and named for, the Combassyian God-King, Banipahl Byzes, these insect-sized machines primarily function as near-undetectable modes of surveillance. Each comes equipped with microneedles capable of delivering toxins, both lethal and non-lethal. In Combassyia, Pahl-drones are ubiquitous. They flit through the streets of Scintevah, indistinguishable from the native midge, constantly relaying reams of data back to the royal palace and the scornful eyes of Byzes’ intelligencers. Beyond Combassyia, use of the Pahl-drone is controversial owing to concerns regarding privacy. The Kingdoms of Knakros, Le’u, and Netusha refuse to use them on principle, while Makaria and Drys deploy them only situationally and sparingly.</p>

        <p>Another notable Ark weapon is the plasma torc: a high-energy metal band that snugly wraps around the arm. Constructed of heat-resistant, superconducting alloys, the torc channels highly ionized gas and projects focused plasma arcs that vary in intensity, depending on the needs of the wearer. Short, weak bursts may be used to disperse crowds and may, at worst, result in mild burns, while intense arcs may reach several thousand degrees, allowing them to burn easily through armor and flesh. Most soldiers, regardless of kingdom, wear a plasma torc around their upper arm; these are often painted with the colors of their respective nation.</p>

        <p>While Ark technology has undoubtedly altered the way humans conduct war, the weapons of the past still remain widely in use. Swords, spears, and bows are still used by warriors, mercenaries, criminals, or any others prone to violence. Not merely for obvious matters of cost, but for matters of sentiment as well. Weapons are, among other things, objects of culture. And humans, perhaps more than most species, cleave to their cultural past. Much like fashion and architecture, human warfare has become a tapestry that seamlessly spins the past and the future, the alien and the human. That said, such archaic weapons are frequently augmented with Ark technology. Such novel syntheses include vibratory bronze swords coated with acidic nanite gels, liquid-nitrogen arrow tips that freeze on impact, shields that release gravitic pulses, etc. The variety of such weapons is nearly endless, as they are often designed by specialist blacksmiths on an ad-hoc basis for individual clients.</p>
