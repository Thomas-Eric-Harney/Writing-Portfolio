            <p>Ark alien innovations have profoundly altered the world of Kassatím, though these changes remain uneven. Assembling Ark alien technology often demands rare, exotic resources, which limits mass production and restricts its widespread use. Furthermore, the process typically requires specialized factories and workshops. As a result, while Ark alien technology is relatively common, it has not wholly transformed the world. Kassatím, therefore, presents a highly incongruous aspect: high-speed, <i>marásh</i>-equipped naval vessels mingle in harbors with traditional sailing ships, while edifices reinforced with advanced metallic alloys retain their pre-Ark architectural simplicity. While no food is scarce due to genetically enhanced crops, basic cereals like wheat and barley remain dietary staples. The cities are illuminated with electrical <i>skeins</i>; meanwhile, much of the countryside remains untouched by artificial light. Ark technology has revolutionized warfare, yet many human warriors still cling to their bronze swords rather than adopting <i>plasma torcs</i>. In essence, Kassatím is a stark blend of antiquity and modernity: the deeply archaic and the astonishingly advanced.</p>

            <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Humans and Science</u></h3>
                <p>In <b>Kassatím</b>, Ark alien sciences and their resultant technologies have been eagerly embraced by most cultures, including Qeret. Consequently, the sciences and their related professions have become integral to society. However, while most Ark aliens may be forthcoming regarding scientific knowledge, most humans still struggle to fully comprehend such intricate subjects. As a result, human "experts" in specialized fields frequently possess only a rudimentary grasp of the fields they study. For instance, a Qereti physicist may understand antimatter as the fundamental opposition to regular matter but would typically lack any deeper insights. Nevertheless, some human scientists are quicker to grasp such topics, often proving to their professional advantage.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Agronomy</h2>

            <p>Of all the Ark alien sciences, Advanced Agronomy has altered human civilization more than any other. Once, famine and drought provided an endless source of anxiety for any human village, city, or empire. Luckily, such whims of nature no longer threaten the world. Farmers now use <i>fertilizer pods</i> to quickly enrich the most barren tracts of land. Talented geneticists have partnered with agronomists to breed unique varieties of wheat and barley that are hardier, more nutritious, and disease resistant. Other inventions are subtler, such as the use of <i>enriched heavy water</i> that sinks deep into the fields. And yet others more noticeable, such as the massive, pivoting <i>silver reflectors</i> that provide additional sunlight onto the wheat and barley fields of the world.</p>
        
            <p>Within Qeret's Ark Sector lies <b>the Greenery</b>, a sprawling greenhouse dedicated to advanced botanical experimentation and breeding operations. Among its most popular innovations are <i>fungal orbs</i>, used by many for their narcotic properties and augmentative effects. By splicing mushrooms with traits from diverse Ark organisms — including various algae, bacteria, plants, and other exotic lifeforms — the botanists of the Greenery have engineered mushrooms capable of inducing temporary epigenetic changes in human cells upon consumption. Orbs might boost physical endurance, bolster the immune system, or heighten cognitive abilities, depending on the variety consumed. These augmentations are accompanied by vivid psychoactive effects, including euphoria, mania, or sanguinity. Each orb, roughly the size of a large bead, is designed for convenience: to induce the desired effect, one merely crushes the orb in hand and quickly inhale the scattered spores.</p>
