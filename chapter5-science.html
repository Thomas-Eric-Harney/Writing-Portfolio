            <p>Ark alien innovations have profoundly altered the world of Kassatím, though these changes remain uneven. Assembling Ark alien technology often demands rare, exotic resources, which limits mass production and restricts its widespread use. Furthermore, the process typically requires specialized factories and workshops. As a result, while Ark alien technology is relatively common, it has not wholly transformed the world. Kassatím, therefore, presents a highly incongruous aspect: high-speed, <i>marásh</i>-equipped naval vessels mingle in harbors with traditional sailing ships, while edifices reinforced with advanced metallic alloys retain their pre-Ark architectural simplicity. While no food is scarce due to genetically enhanced crops, basic cereals like wheat and barley remain dietary staples. The cities are illuminated with electrical <i>skeins</i>; meanwhile, much of the countryside remains untouched by artificial light. Ark technology has revolutionized warfare, yet many human warriors still cling to their bronze swords rather than adopting <i>plasma torcs</i>. In essence, Kassatím is a stark blend of antiquity and modernity: the deeply archaic and the astonishingly advanced.</p>

                <p>In <b>Kassatím</b>, Ark alien sciences and their resultant technologies have been eagerly embraced by most cultures, including Qeret. Consequently, the sciences and their related professions have become integral to society. However, while most Ark aliens may be forthcoming regarding scientific knowledge, most humans still struggle to fully comprehend such intricate subjects. As a result, human "experts" in specialized fields frequently possess only a rudimentary grasp of the fields they study. For instance, a Qereti physicist may understand antimatter as the fundamental opposition to regular matter but would typically lack any deeper insights. Nevertheless, some human scientists are quicker to grasp such topics, often proving to their professional advantage.</p>
