          Ark alien innovations have profoundly altered the world of Kassatím,
          though these changes remain uneven. Assembling Ark alien technology
          often demands rare, exotic resources, which limits mass production and
          restricts its widespread use. Furthermore, the process typically
          requires specialized factories and workshops. As a result, while Ark
          alien technology is relatively common, it has not wholly transformed
          the world. Kassatím, therefore, presents a highly incongruous aspect:
          high-speed, <i>marásh</i>-equipped naval vessels mingle in harbors
          with traditional sailing ships, while edifices reinforced with
          advanced metallic alloys retain their pre-Ark architectural
          simplicity. While no food is scarce due to genetically enhanced crops,
          basic cereals like wheat and barley remain dietary staples. The cities
          are illuminated with electrical <i>skeins</i>; meanwhile, much of the
          countryside remains untouched by artificial light. And while Ark
          technology may have revolutionized warfare, many human warriors still
          cling to their bronze swords rather than adopting <i>plasma torcs</i>. In
          essence, Kassatím is a stark blend of antiquity and modernity: the
          deeply archaic and the astonishingly advanced.

        <p>
          In <strong>Kassatím</strong>, Ark alien sciences and their resultant
          technologies have been eagerly embraced by most cultures, including
          Qeret. Consequently, the sciences and their related professions have
          become integral to society. However, while most Ark aliens may be
          forthcoming regarding scientific knowledge, most humans still struggle
          to fully comprehend such intricate subjects. As a result, human
          "experts" in specialized fields frequently possess only a rudimentary
          grasp of the fields they study. For instance, a Qereti physicist may
          understand antimatter as the fundamental opposition to regular matter
          but would typically lack any deeper insights. Nevertheless, some human
          scientists are quicker to grasp such topics, often proving to their
          professional advantage.

        <h2>Advanced Agronomy</h2>

        <p>
          Of all the Ark alien sciences, Advanced Agronomy has altered human
          civilization more than any other. Once, famine and drought provided an
          endless source of anxiety for any human village, city, or empire.
          Luckily, such whims of nature no longer threaten the world. Farmers
          now use <i>fertilizer pods</i> to quickly enrich the most barren
          tracts of land. Talented geneticists have partnered with agronomists
          to breed unique varieties of wheat and barley that are hardier, more
          nutritious, and disease resistant. Other inventions are subtler, such
          as the use of <i>enriched heavy water</i> that sinks deep into the
          fields. And yet others more noticeable, such as the massive, pivoting
          <i>silver reflectors</i> that provide additional sunlight onto the
          wheat and barley fields of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within Qeret's Ark Sector lies <strong>the Greenery</strong>, a sprawling
          greenhouse dedicated to advanced botanical experimentation and
          breeding operations. Among its most popular innovations are
          <i>fungal orbs</i>, used by many for their narcotic properties and
          augmentative effects. By splicing mushrooms with traits from diverse
          Ark organisms — including various algae, bacteria, plants, and other
          exotic lifeforms — the botanists of the Greenery have engineered
          mushrooms capable of inducing temporary epigenetic changes in human
          cells upon consumption. Orbs might boost physical endurance, bolster
          the immune system, or heighten cognitive abilities, depending on the
          variety consumed. These augmentations are accompanied by vivid
          psychoactive effects, including euphoria, mania, or sanguinity. Each
          orb, roughly the size of a large bead, is designed for convenience: to
          induce the desired effect, one merely crushes the orb in hand and
          quickly inhale the scattered spores.

        <h2>Ark Weaponry</h2>

        <p>
          War-chariots once ruled the battlefields of Kassatím, often serving as
          the decisive factor in military engagements. Highly mobile, quick, and
          devastating at range, war-chariots could end most battles conclusively
          or deter them altogether. With the arrival of the Ark, this paradigm
          of war endures, but the instruments have changed. Victory now belongs
          to the nation that deploys the greatest arsenal of Ark weapons to the
          battlefield.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps most destructive, and most sought after, is the fell
          <i>particle hammer</i>. These weighty, expensive, and cumbersome
          devices are capable of disintegrating thousands of combatants in mere
          moments. When activated, these leviathans of titanium and pulsating
          plasma conduits release blinding shafts of beta particles woven with
          gamma rays. Impact from a particle hammer’s roiling violet light
          initiates a near-instantaneous cascade of atomic disintegration as
          particles burrow into molecular bonds, rending them with ease.
          Excluding <strong>Knakros</strong>, the accumulation of particle hammers is a
          top priority for the six <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#greatkingdoms-entry">Great Kingdoms</a></strong> of Kassatím. Though, despite
          the rising number of such devices — some estimates place the total
          around 10,000 — the Great Kingdoms have thus far exercised
          unprecedented restraint, as particle hammers have yet to be deployed
          in battle. Many advocates for peace across Kassatím have called for
          the dismantling of each and every particle hammer in existence and an
          inter-kingdom proscription on their use and construction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Less destructive, but equally concerning, are the diminutive devices
          known as <i>Pahl-drones</i>. Developed on behalf of, and named for,
          the Combassyian God-King, Banipahl Byzes, these insect-sized machines
          primarily function as near-undetectable modes of surveillance. Each
          comes equipped with microneedles capable of delivering toxins, both
          lethal and non-lethal. In Combassyia, Pahl-drones are ubiquitous. They
          flit through the streets of Scintevah, indistinguishable from the
          native midge, constantly relaying reams of data back to the royal
          palace and the scornful eyes of Byzes’ intelligencers. Beyond
          Combassyia, use of the Pahl-drone is controversial owing to concerns
          regarding privacy. The Kingdoms of Knakros, <strong>Léu</strong>, and
          <strong>Netusha</strong> refuse to use them on principle, while
          <strong>Makaria</strong> and <strong>Drys</strong> deploy them only situationally and
          sparingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another notable Ark weapon is the plasma torc: a high-energy metal
          band that snugly wraps around the arm. Constructed of heat-resistant,
          superconducting alloys, the torc channels highly ionized gas and
          projects focused plasma arcs that vary in intensity, depending on the
          needs of the wearer. Short, weak bursts may be used to disperse crowds
          and may, at worst, result in mild burns, while intense arcs may reach
          several thousand degrees, allowing them to burn easily through armor
          and flesh. Most soldiers, regardless of kingdom, wear a plasma torc
          around their upper arm; these are often painted with the colors of
          their respective nation.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Ark technology has undoubtedly altered the way humans conduct
          war, the weapons of the past still remain widely in use. Swords,
          spears, and bows are still used by warriors, mercenaries, criminals,
          or any others prone to violence. Not merely for obvious matters of
          cost, but for matters of sentiment as well. Weapons are, among other
          things, objects of culture. And humans, perhaps more than most
          species, cleave to their cultural past. Much like fashion and
          architecture, human warfare has become a tapestry that seamlessly
          spins the past and the future, the alien and the human. That said,
          such archaic weapons are frequently augmented with Ark technology.
          Such novel syntheses include vibratory bronze swords coated with
          acidic nanite gels, liquid-nitrogen arrow tips that freeze on impact,
          shields that release gravitic pulses, etc. The variety of such weapons
          is nearly endless, as they are often designed by specialist
          blacksmiths on an ad-hoc basis for individual clients.

        <h2>Atelonics</h2>

        <p>
          The scientific discipline of Atelonics examines the fundamental
          particles that constitute matter, their interactions, the forces that
          govern them, and the mechanisms by which energy is transferred or
          exchanged.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup> The
          achievements of this field extend far beyond incomprehensible
          theoretical musings, however; it has spurred numerous essential
          innovations that have enhanced Kassatím’s infrastructure, refined its
          communication networks, and vastly improved its management of energy
          resources within its urban centers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the Ark’s arrival, the vessel’s vast array of antihydrogen
          drives was harvested, transported, and retrofitted to power each of
          the major cities of Qeret. These <i>antihydrogen power plants</i> not
          only meet but vastly exceed the energy demands of entire cities. At
          their core, the plants produce trace amounts of antihydrogen, an
          antimatter counterpart to hydrogen that annihilates upon contact with
          regular matter. Magnetic containment fields prevent the antihydrogen
          from interacting prematurely, ensuring controlled and immensely
          energetic reactions. From these plants, <i>skeins</i> — needle-thin
          electronic pathways embedded in urban infrastructure — channel power
          generated by these antimatter reactions throughout the city for
          lighting, heating, cooking, and scientific experimentation (see
          <strong>Macrotech</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Ark alien atelonicists, supplemented by precocious human researchers,
          have also extended their efforts across the electromagnetic spectrum
          and beyond. This includes <i>magnetic railways</i> to transport goods
          and passengers at incredible speeds,<sup
            ><a href="#footnote2" id="back-to-text2">2</a></sup
          >
          <i>plasmatic forcefields</i> capable of creating localized zones of
          protective, super-heated plasma, and the terrifying particle hammers —
          a devastating class of Ark weaponry (see <strong>Ark Weaponry</strong>). Of
          particular note are <i>Kezamir engines</i>, which extract zero-point
          energy from vacuums to generate propulsion without fuel. Although
          prohibitively expensive to manufacture, these engines are expected to
          revolutionize terrestrial and aerial travel once mass production
          becomes viable. Currently, most naval vessels rely on the more
          accessible water-powered <i>márash</i> systems (see <strong>Macrotech</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Another groundbreaking achievement is the operational use of entangled
          particles. Leveraging some particularly baroque artifacts salvaged
          from the Ark, <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#macroform-entry">macroform</a></i> scientists in <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#makar-entry">Makar</a></strong> have engineered
          long-distance communication devices known as <i>relays</i>. These
          devices enable the instantaneous transfer of digital and verbal
          information between cities, bridging vast distances faster than the
          speed of light. However, their exorbitant cost restricts their use to
          city leaders and the immensely wealthy.<sup
            ><a href="#footnote3" id="back-to-text3">3</a></sup
          >
          Despite this limitation, the relay has prevented (and exacerbated)
          numerous economic and military conflicts since its introduction.

        <h2>Genomics</h2>

        <p>
          Genomics is the science and practice of editing human, animal, and
          plant genomes. Within several decades after the Ark’s arrival, the Ark
          Aliens had successfully mapped and decoded the genomes of most native
          creatures in Kassatím, including humans. Shortly thereafter, they
          introduced the delicate art of Genomics to the human population. Using
          ancient techniques perfected aboard the Ark, genomicists are able to
          make broad, fundamental, and inheritable alterations to any living
          creature.<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="back-to-text4">4</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
          Their first major contribution to humanity was a “cocktail” of
          <i>fortified genes</i> that rendered humans resistant to disease and
          illness; effectively tripling the average lifespan of humanity
          overnight. This triumph was soon eclipsed by the advent of
          <i>antisenescence treatments</i>, a genetic innovation that
          drastically retarded the aging process and, theoretically, enabled
          human immortality. This has naturally led to an explosion in the human
          population of Kassatím and the average age now rests well above 100.
          In fact, it is not uncommon to meet elder citizens who yet recall a
          time before the Ark, having received antisenescence treatments after
          its arrival.
        </p>

        <p>
          For those that cannot afford expensive antisenescence treatments,
          there are less efficacious <i>renewal treatments</i> that merely
          revert the body to a younger state; such treatments are generally
          offered freely at facilities known as <strong>Resurrection Temples</strong>. In
          the unfortunate event that an individual’s life is cut short — whether
          through fatal mishap or murder — death is not necessarily final. By
          submerging bodies within pods known as <i>resurrection creches</i>,
          the dead may be retrieved. Once a body is submerged, nutrient-rich and
          synthetic amniotic fluids — in addition to many swarming
          <i>dust</i> nanites — work to vivify damaged tissue and carefully
          restore cellular functions and synaptic patterns. However, this does
          not come without a cost. When resurrecting the dead, resurrection
          creches extensively reverse the age of the body (in a manner akin to
          renewal procedures), meaning that an individual temporarily returns to
          having the body of an adolescent. This period of youth is accelerated,
          but patients must spend a month in the Temple, attended by specialist
          physicians and priests, until their body has returned to its original
          age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most major cities of Kassatím host Resurrection Temples, ensuring
          their services remain geographically accessible to most of the human
          and Ark alien populations. While antisenescence remains a privilege of
          the affluent, Resurrection Temples will typically provide their
          renewal and resurrection treatments free of charge.

        <h2>Macrotech</h2>

        <p>
          Macrotechnology, or simply “macrotech,” is a broad classification for
          all computerized technology constructed from components larger than
          the <i>Dust</i> nanites utilized in the related field of nanotech.
          Perhaps the most widespread of these devices is the <i>Ark tablet</i>.
          In shape, these thin, rectangular slabs recall the iconic clay tablets
          once used by humanity for accounting purposes and literature.
          Functionally, however, they surpass mere information storage. Friends
          and families may maintain close correspondence; shopkeepers compile
          tabular inventories; prudent scientists perform rudimentary virtual
          experiments to refine hypotheses; visual artists use them to draft
          precise sketches; and architects leverage their computational
          capabilities to create structurally sound blueprints before
          construction of a project even begins. Ark tablets are mass-produced
          in prosperous cities like Qeret, and — excepting the truly destitute —
          most citizens carry one at all times.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another ubiquitous device, and equally vital, is the <i>prompter</i>:
          a language-translating machine embedded in the ear that converts an
          interlocutor’s speech into the user’s native tongue. During the
          <strong>Long Century of Integration</strong>, prompters were indispensable,
          bridging the linguistic divide between humans and the newly arrived
          Ark aliens. Additionally, they have facilitated effortless
          communication among Kassatím’s diverse human ethnicities. Beyond the
          odd hermit or rural asectish, nearly every inhabitant of Kassatím,
          human or otherwise, possesses a minuscule silver prompter implanted
          within their ear canal (or biologically analogous orifice).
        </p>

        <p>
          Most urban environments in Kassatím, including Qeret, are laced with
          thin, ultra-conductive copper cables known as <i>skeins</i>, whose
          primary function is to transfer power directly from an antihydrogen
          powerplant to the rest of the city. Instead of a single wire, skeins
          use braided copper strands alloyed with silver to maximize
          conductivity. These softly glowing skeins are embedded into the walls,
          roofs, and streets of a city. For this reason, architects often use
          them creatively to limn palaces, temples, and market areas with
          shimmering light. Everything from a structure’s central heating to its
          lighting are powered by the city’s elaborate skein network, though,
          the poorest sectors often fall outside of this energy grid.
        </p>

        <p>
          Holographic projecting devices known as <i>lanterns</i> are
          exceedingly popular among the Qereti. Matte and oblique-cone-shaped,
          these unassuming devices fulfill two primary functions. First, they
          emit scanning rays of light that capture three-dimensional activities.
          Second, they project holographic recordings of those same events,
          rendered in user-programmed colors, known as “hololoops.” In Qeret,
          lanterns are utilized for both commercial purposes —such as
          holographic shop signs, elaborate advertisements, and product displays
          — and artistic endeavors, including the recording and projection of
          traditional Adonian dance performances.<sup

        </p>

        <p>
          Among the most useful macrotech innovations have been the mechanical
          attendants known as servitors. These semi-sentient automatons have
          freed the population from performing the drudge work and menial tasks
          that every city depends on, but few relish actually doing. Garbage
          collection, sewer work, factory labor, etc., are all accomplished by
          the omnipresent servitors. Not only can one see servitors in the
          streets of Qeret, but also in the many Qereti establishments known as
          bachnals, where they serve food and drink (and mop up the occasional
          puddle of retch). Most well-off Qereti families own at least one
          servitor that functions as a servant, with some even serving as
          personal assistants and constant companions.<sup
            ><a href="#footnote6" id="back-to-text6">6</a></sup
          >
          While each servitor is typically custom-built, the standard model is a
          lanky, child-sized automaton distinguished by its beady eye receptors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of particular importance to the Qereti is the water-powered engine
          known as the <i>marásh</i>. These sophisticated machines propel Qereti
          naval vessels across the <strong>Cerulean</strong> at high speeds. Their design
          utilizes water as both fuel and propellant by harnessing heat and
          pressure to generate thrust. Seawater is drawn into the marásh
          reservoir, where it is rapidly heated by sunlight concentrated through
          a specialized lens. The resulting high-pressure steam is expelled
          through a narrow nozzle at the ship’s stern, producing forward
          momentum. Trained navigators adjust the nozzles and valves to regulate
          steam output, allowing precise control over speed and maneuverability.
          Naturally, the hulls of marásh-equipped vessels must be reinforced to
          withstand the increased velocity. By enabling rapid transit over the
          sea, the marásh has revolutionized naval trade, particularly for the
          coastal cities of Kassatím such as Qeret.

        <h2>Microtech</h2>

        <p>
          Microtech refers to the science of, and engineering of, microscopic,
          computerized machines referred to as nanites, or simply “<i>Dust</i>.”
          Extending a mere 60 microns in length, a single “grain” of Dust is
          barely perceptible to the human eye, and clouds of them resemble
          dusky, floating masses of dirt (hence the moniker). Though expensive
          to manufacture, and resource intensive, these nanites accomplish many
          crucial tasks. For instance, they help maintain structures, ships, and
          tools by cleaning, polishing, and performing small repairs on metal or
          woodwork, making them invaluable to artisans and shipwrights. They are
          also employed in Resurrection Temples where they are used as healing
          aids capable of treating wounds or even reconstructing flesh, whole
          cloth. Resurrection creches, in particular, rely on the slow, but
          effective, process of using Dust to reform damaged or missing flesh.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dust is often used to augment agronomic practices as well. Capable of
          combating pests, creating shade, and purifying water, it is not
          uncommon to see ominous clouds of Dust swirling around the Qereti
          wheat and barley fields on the mainland. Some cartographers and
          adventurers use pouches of Dust as exploration tools by dispersing
          them over unfamiliar terrain to map regions and detect obstacles. This
          practice serves traders and sailors as well, who use Dust to scan
          coastlines and rivers. Some painters have employed it as a means to
          stretch artistic boundaries by creating finer details, intricate
          patterns, and curious textures that the human hand — or analogous Ark
          alien appendage — could not otherwise achieve. These nanites can even
          create moving displays or surfaces, adding a dynamic, shimmering
          quality to a piece. And more frivolously, Dust often serves a
          decorative role by adorning clothing with shifting and temporary
          patterns that symbolize rank, accomplishment, or merely reflect garish
          personal taste. Though common, one may not always be aware of the
          Dust’s presence. Whether it is toxin detection, air quality control,
          water purification, building maintenance, etc., these nanites work
          without end, contributing to the urban environments of Kassatím
          perhaps more than any other technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Qeret, many citizens have been enhanced with Dust-infused tattoos
          known as <i>Ark works</i>. This creative fusion of biotechnology,
          nanotechnology, and cultural artistry has become a relatively common
          sight in the city. Ark work dye is derived from a variety of natural
          sources such as plants, minerals, and even sea creatures (as is the
          case with the native murex snail, which naturally produces the hue
          known as Qereti Violet). These dyes serve as a base before Dust
          nanites are suspended within the ink and finely powdered electrum is
          mixed in, enabling the ink-Dust solution to interact with the body’s
          innate bioelectricity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once applied, Ark work tattoos can perform a variety of augmentative
          functions. For instance, by connecting directly to the body’s nervous
          system, an Ark work may temporarily enhance an individual’s reflexes,
          strength, or perception. They may also act as conductive pathways,
          allowing the wearer to store external energy (e.g., from skeins), only
          to be released as explosive bursts of strength or speed. The tattoos
          can work reactively or by deliberate neural signal. One might
          intentionally trigger a burst of adrenaline before a casual foot race,
          or the Ark work might reflexively lower the wearer’s heartrate when
          they are faced with anxiety. Ark work activation does not come without
          cost to the wearer, however. Such unnatural manipulations of the
          body’s biochemistry take their toll, and one must generally contend
          with fatigue and mental exhaustion after activating one’s Ark work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ark work patterns and designs are typically influenced by Qereti
          cultural motifs. Wavy lines symbolize the sea and can frequently be
          seen on the biceps of sailor’s arms and on shipwright’s hands.
          Depictions of Nasiru, tutelary god of Qeret, often adorn the flesh of
          the pious, and baroque portraits of the Ark are exceedingly common as
          well. Ark works can be acquired from specialist artist-technicians
          throughout the city, though the most reputed shop for the procedure is
          known as the <strong>Blackworks</strong>, located in the <strong>Ark Sector</strong>.

        <h2>Spectrography</h2>

        <p>
          A significant hurdle in utilizing Ark tech within such a primitive
          environment is the scarcity of resources. Each of these technologies,
          along with the factories used to construct them, require precious
          metals and materials that were previously inaccessible — and, in many
          cases, entirely unknown — to humans before the Ark. Some of the most
          advanced examples, including relays, antihydrogen power plants, and
          particle hammers, consist of parts that must be harvested directly
          from the Ark itself, a deceptively endless spring. However, for
          society to develop new devices independent of the Ark, it must secure
          reliable sources of exotic materials. While the framework of a
          laboratory or factory can be fashioned from limestone and cedar, the
          intricate machinery within demands cobalt, osmium, bismuth, quartz,
          and more. Thus arises the need for Spectrography.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spectrography is a broad term encompassing the tools and techniques
          used to procure both rare and common resources essential to the modern
          world of Kassatím. Deep-probing spectrometers, commonly referred to as
          <i>assessors</i>, scan vast expanses of land, mountain, and seabed,
          swiftly identifying deposits rich in precious metals. Once a deposit
          is detected, heavy <i>boring hammers</i> — closely related to the
          particle hammer (see <strong>Ark Weaponry</strong>)— carve a path to the prize.
          The extracted materials are then recovered by durable mining
          servitors, engineered to withstand extreme pressure and inhospitable
          conditions. This entire process often unfolds without direct human or
          Ark alien oversight; government officials or Ark alien supervisors
          simply issue directives and activate these automated mining
          operations, known as “<i>spectro sites</i>,” in designated locations.
          Currently, human society has minimal regard for environmental
          conservation, and there is little concern for the effects of extensive
          mining on the rural regions of Kassatím. However, prudent Ark aliens
          involved in such operations will generally avoid culturally
          significant landmarks, such as Mt. Betta on the Adonian mainland.

            When first introduced, the prototype servitors had been utterly
            non-sentient, pre-programmed automatons. However, the humans found
            these bygone models profoundly off-putting. Their lack of any clear
            identity or personality rendered them too uncanny for most humans to
            stomach. Later models would be altered to possess enough sentience
            to possess personalities, to converse, and even to have unique and
            colorful personalities. That said, servitors do not possess
            free-will as such; they <i>must</i> comply with their programmed
            directives, and they <i>always</i> relish doing so. According to
            some, such as the adherents of <strong>Izabel’s Rapture</strong>, the use of
            servitors amounts to little better than slavery.<a
