            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p><strong>Return to Mycenae</strong> is a role-playing game set in a world deeply rooted in Greek mythology and history, combining an intricately plotted narrative with strategically challenging combat systems. The game follows siblings <strong>Alexander</strong> and <strong>Isadora</strong>, rumored descendants of the last hero of the ancient <strong>Mycenaean Empire</strong> (<strong>Alexion</strong>), as they uncover the buried secrets of their bloodline and the remnants of that bygone civilization. Their journey spans the fractured realms of <strong>Pelagon</strong> – from the scholarly coasts of Ionia to the windswept plateaus of Aeolia, the mountain strongholds of Doria, and the pristine marble forums of Attia – ultimately leading to a fateful return through time to the lost city of <strong>Mycenae</strong>.</p>
        
            <p>Inspired by classic SNES-era JRPGs — most notably <i>Final Fantasy IV</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>VI</i> — <i>Return to Mycenae</i> seeks to capture the spirit of epic storytelling, memorable character-driven narratives, and the strategic, turn-based combat that defined the golden age of the genre.</p>

            <p>Gameplay features an <strong>Action Pool System (APS)</strong> where the player’s party and enemies act in alternating team turns. Each team receives a limited pool of Actions at the start of its turn, and tactical decisions dynamically affect this pool: exploiting elemental weaknesses or landing critical hits can grant extra actions, while hitting resistances or other missteps can penalize the team by consuming additional actions. Combat is further deepened by a <strong>six-element Magic System</strong> interwoven with the APS mechanics and a flexible <strong>Badge System</strong> that lets players customize characters’ elemental affinities and abilities. The design emphasizes strategy and synergy. Players must intelligently leverage elemental affinities, craft suitable Badges, balance party aptitudes, manage scarce mana resource, and coordinate character skills to prevail in battle.</p>

            <p><i>Return to Mycenae</i> is designed to deliver the gameplay depth of <i>Final Fantasy V</i>, encouraging experimentation, clever builds, and true mastery of its systems, while offering a narrative as thematically ambitious and emotionally resonant as <i>Final Fantasy VI</i>. It unfolds in a setting that is both unique and culturally familiar: a reimagined Aegean world where familar history, myth, and magic coelsce in strange and novel ways.</p>

        <section id="setting-world">
            <h2>Setting</h2>
             <p>The story unfolds in the maritime world of Pelagon, a land of fractured kingdoms that echoes a mythic past. Pelagon’s setting draws inspiration from Ancient Greek mythology, history, and culture. Millennia ago, all lands were united under the Mycenaean Empire, but a cataclysm known as the <strong>Great Sundering</strong> shattered the continent of Pelagon, breaking both land and cultural unity, leaving behind only scattered nations and cyclopean ruins – silent reminders of an age swallowed by calamity.</p>

            <p>Pelagon is divided into four distinct nations, each carrying the elemental legacy of the lost Mycenaean Empire:</p>

            <ul class="triangle-list left-triangle-list">
                <li><strong>Aeolia</strong>: A scattered archipelago of towering cliffs, windswept plateaus, and half-mad oracles. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Air – Aēr – Ψ</i>)</li>
                <li><strong>Attia</strong>: A densely populated region of exuberant cities, marble-spired palaces, and urban intrigue. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Fire – Pyr – Φ</i>)</li>
                <li><strong>Doria</strong>: A mountain enclave of stone fortresses and iron-willed ascetics. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Earth – Gē – Δ</i>)</li>
                <li><strong>Ionia</strong>: A cosmopolitan coast of open harbors, bustling markets, and winding archives. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Water – Hydōr – Ω</i>)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In ages past, these realms were one. <strong>King Polydamas</strong> ruled from the golden citadel of Mycenae until the Great Sundering fractured Pelagon, effectively severing each nation from the other, both culturally and geographically. In the present day, each nation’s culture and magic is tethered to its elemental affinity, while the ruins of Mycenae lie hidden, shrouding ancient secrets.</p>

            <p>Magic in Pelagon draws from six elemental currents: the four Primary Elements (<strong>Air, Fire, Earth, Water</strong>) tied to the regions above, and two Divine Elements — <strong>Light</strong> (<i>Aither</i>) and <strong>Shadow</strong> (<i>Nyx</i>) — which are shrouded in mystery and myth. These elemental forces infuse every aspect of Pelagon’s world, from its geography and politics to each nation's respective superstitions. Mastery of the elements will prove essential as the heroes venture forth, for even the gods themselves are bound by this elemental balance.</p>

        <section id="narrative-overview">
            <h2>Narrative Overview</h2>
            <p>The narrative of <i>Return to Mycenae</i> is structured into a <strong>Prologue</strong> and <strong>five Acts</strong>, each tied to a region of Pelagon and a phase of the party’s journey. The tale follows Alexander and Isadora from an unremarkable village life to the threshold of legend, as they unearth the hidden legacy of Polydamas — the last Mycenaean king whose reign ended in betrayal — and confront enemies both mortal and divine, from the fractured city-states of the present to the long-absent deities known as the Myrion. These encounters will draw them into the veiled designs of the Gods, compel them to cross the boundaries of time, and pit them against the encroaching shadow of Nyx.</p>
            
            <h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3>

            <p>In the quiet village of <strong>Lysara</strong>, siblings Alexander and Isadora celebrate the spring festival of <i>Kleos Kairos</i> when the festival is shattered by an unexpected assault of twisted, armor-clad figures with an unsettling and inhuman cast descend upon the village, proclaiming themselves the <strong>"King's Acolytes."</strong> The siblings repel the initial assault. After the battle, <strong>Elder Callisthenes</strong> warns that the surviving creatures have fled north into the <strong>Ephyra Vale</strong>, toward ancient Mycenaean ruins hidden in the forested crags. Alexander and Isadora give chase through the treacherous vale, battling beasts and stray Acolytes, navigating the crumbling remnants of a bygone age. In the depths of the ruins, they confront <strong>Fireforged Kharon</strong>, an imposing monstrosity wreathed in malignant black flames. Upon defeating Kharon, they find a vast sigil scorched into the stone floor of its lair — <strong>the mark of Nyx, an ominous “Χ”</strong> whose meaning is as ancient as it is dire. This discovery sets them on a course that will unravel the truth of their bloodline, the lost Empire, and the fate of Pelagon itself.</p>

            <h3 id="act1">Act I: Ionia</h3>
            
            <p>Alexander and Isadora investigate the sigil “Χ” found in Ephyra Vale and its link to their Mycenaean bloodline. In Ionia, they consult scholars to recover fragments of imperial history and uncover the <strong>Hydōr water-magic</strong> tradition. They recruit <strong>Nereus</strong>, a skilled and reclusive water mage, and locate the <strong>Submerged Mycenaean Archive</strong>: an underwater ruin preserving imperial records. Clearing the archive yields their first Badge (Nereus proceeds to explain the <strong>Badge System</strong>) and a fresco revealing a lost truth: the murder of the god <strong>Eirene</strong> during the Fall of Mycenae. Beneath her figure lies the symbol of Aither (Θ), clearly inscribed with its name; beneath her shadow-wreathed slayer, too eroded to identify, lies the mark of <strong>Nyx (X)</strong>, likewise labeled. These discoveries provide vital clues and set their course, pointing them toward the Oracles of Aeolia as the only ones capable of interpreting such mysteries. With Nereus’ aid, they secure passage aboard a vessel bound for Aeolia. </p>

            <h3 id="act2">Act II: Aeolia</h3>

            <p>Alexander, Isadora, and Nereus journey to Aeolia, seeking the Oracles’ wisdom regarding the sigil of Nyx. In Aeolia, they begin their training in <strong>Aēr</strong>, learning the air-magic tradition. The Oracles of the <strong>Skyclad Monastery</strong> reveal the oracular prophecy of the Last Hero:</p>


            <section class="section-box" id="oracular-prophecy">
        <p>
          <i>“He who bore the Crown of Mycenae sought to bend the world in his likeness. By shadow was the throne taken, by shadow was it lost.Yet the mirror cracks anew, and two faces peer from the fracture. One shall begin what the other began, <strong>eis tous aionas ton aionon.</strong>”</i>
        </p>
      </section>

      <p>One Oracle, more perceptive and unsettling than the rest, quietly guides the siblings through veiled questions and half-revealed answers. Though unnamed, this figure steers them toward key insights about the sigil “Χ” and their lineage—an intervention later revealed to have been the work of <strong>Phanes</strong>, Unveiler of Truths, ensuring that the siblings grasp the knowledge necessary to pursue their fate.</p>

      <p>The Oracles also explain the cosmic dichotomy of <strong>Aither and Nyx — Light and Shadow</strong>. Aither is the domain of <strong>the Myrion</strong>, the gods; Nyx is darkness unbound, an extension of the abyss herself. During these revelations, Alexander and Isadora recruit <strong>Ianthe</strong>, a rogue air-mage, who joins the party with her knowledge of Aeolian magic. Together, they infiltrate the <strong>Skyclad Monastery</strong>, uncovering the rituals that bind prophecy to the wind and confronting its dangers. Their victory secures not only the Oracles’ truths but also an airship, granting them passage across the skies to <strong>Doria</strong>, the original home of Alexion, the Last Hero.</p>

            <p><b>Dungeon:</b> Skyclad Monastery</p>

            <h3 id="act3">Act III: Doria</h3>

            <p>Alexander, Isadora, Ianthe, and Nereus travel by airship to the mountain realm of Doria, where strength and tradition define its people. They seek an audience with the <strong>Twin Kings, Nikandros and Timaios</strong>, hoping to uncover truths surrounding Alexion, the Last Hero. Among the fortified citadels and stone-hewn halls, the siblings begin training in <strong>Gē</strong>, the earth-magic tradition of endurance and might. The party are guided towards the <strong>Tomb of Alexion</strong>, revered as the resting place of the Last Hero.</p>

            <p>Before they can reach the tomb, the party encounters a severe and taciturn figure moving through Doria’s high passes: a veiled woman bearing the symbols of judgment and finality. Without naming herself, she warns them that some legacies are meant to end, not be unearthed, and that the past, once disturbed, demands a reckoning. Through subtle obstruction—collapsed routes, misdirection, and moments of uncanny ill fortune—she attempts to delay their progress. Only later will it become clear that this was the work of <strong>Atropos</strong>, Weaver of Destiny’s End, seeking to sever a time-bound fate before it can fully take hold.</p>

            <p>Undeterred, the party presses onward to the Tomb. Within its shadowed halls, the truth begins to surface: Alexion is the “True King” whom the King’s Acolytes serve. Once thought a savior, Alexion was in fact corrupted by Nyx, and his final living act was the usurpation and murder of Mycenaean King <strong>Polydamas</strong>.</p>

            <p>At the tomb’s depths, the party faces the Acolyte champion <strong>Stonebound Brontes</strong>, a hulking warrior fused with blackened rock and veins of Nyxian fire. In the brutal confrontation, <strong>Nereus is slain</strong>, sacrificing himself to protect the others. Though victorious, the battle leaves its mark: Alexander begins to exhibit unsettling signs of Nyxian corruption, hinting at a dangerous kinship with the power that claimed Alexion.</p>

            <p>This revelation binds the siblings’ fates more tightly to the enigma of Alexion and the sigil “Χ,” as the Acolytes grow bolder in their designs. Echoes of the Oracles’ warnings return with renewed urgency, and counsel from the Twin Kings points them eastward to Attia, where imperial archives may yet yield answers to stemming Nyx’s corruption.</p>

            <p><b>Dungeon:</b> Tomb of Alexion</p>

            <h3 id="act4">Act IV: Attia</h3>

            <p>Alexander, Isadora, and Ianthe arrive in <strong>Attia</strong> via airship, whose sprawling cities and marble forums are governed by the <strong>Pyric Assembly</strong>. Within the Assembly they find a fractured polity: one faction, compromised by Acolyte conspirators, seeks to dissolve the Assembly and enthrone this enigmatic “True King”; a second urges open war against the Acolytes; a third advocates a city-wide referendum to let the people decide Attia’s course. Moving between these blocs is <strong>Archimedes</strong>, a picaro fire-sorcerer and disgraced yet influential member of the Assembly, whose amoral methods have earned him countless enemies (and debtors). He joins the party, tutoring them in <strong>Pyr</strong>, Attian fire magic, while helping them navigate the council’s politics in search of a way to sway Assembly sentiments.</p>

            <p>Rumors point the party to the <strong>Mausoleum of King Polydamas</strong>, where records concerning the hidden elements <strong>Aither (Θ) and Nyx (Χ)</strong> were once stored. Inside, they discover the archives systematically destroyed and, for the first time, come face to face with Alexion. In a private confrontation amid the shattered tablets, Alexion reveals himself as the “True King” served by the Acolytes and justifies his regicide and Nyx-born power as necessary to remake Pelagon. He invites Alexander to join his vision and, more subtly, plants the idea of traveling back to the final days of Mycenae to avert the Sundering. Alexander refuses him, and though the party confirms that the Mycenaean downfall sprang from the Nyxian exploits of Alexion, rather than simple divine abandonment, their search for a cure to Nyxian corruption reaches a dead end: all relevant Attian research has already been purged on Alexion’s orders.</p>

            <p>Clues uncovered in Attia instead point downward, to the <strong>Sanctum of the Kairostratum</strong>, a subterranean complex built around the ribcage of <strong>Kairos, god of Time</strong>. Descending into the Sanctum, the party enters the ribcage, known as the Kairostratum, beginning their passage through the tides of time. Within this temporal maelstrom they confront Kairos, who manifests to bar their crossing. Speaking only in oblique fragments, he alludes to having faced them across uncountable iterations and insists that their journey can only perpetuate the loop. The battle unfolds within the shifting currents of time, culminating in Kairos shattering into temporal fragments. His ribcage — the Kairostratum — hurtles backwards into the distant past (lodging itself within the Sanctum), even as the Kairostratum carrying the party continues its trajectory, creating the paradox of two Kairostrata existing simultaneously. Pressing onward, the party is cast five millennia back to the final days of Mycenae.</p>

                <h3 class="centered-heading">Ending A</h3>
                <p>
                    At the threshold of the Kairostratum, Alexander and Isadora may choose not to enter the ribcage of Kairos and refuse the temptation to unmake the past. In that moment of restraint, the pull of Nyx abruptly loosens its hold. The Nyxian corruption afflicting Alexander dissipates, the fractures of the Sundering quietly mend, the King’s Acolytes vanish as if erased from history, and Alexion himself fades from the world, his paradox unraveled.
                </p>

                <p>After the credits, players may reload their save to pursue the alternate path: entering the Kairostratum and initiating the time loop that leads into Act V.</p>

            <h3 id="act5">Act V: Return to Mycenae</h3>

            <p>Traveling through time via the Kairostratum, Alexander and Isadora arrive in the final days of the Mycenaean Empire. The city stands resplendent and whole, yet strained by civil unrest quietly fomented in secret: factional strife, manufactured shortages, and whispered dissent seeded by Alexion long before his open betrayal. Within the palace, the siblings encounter <strong>King Polydamas</strong>, the last ruler of Mycenae, and attempt to divert the catastrophe foretold by prophecy. Their presence, rather than averting fate, tightens its weave.</p>
            <p>They soon witness Polydamas’s betrayal and murder at the hands of Alexion, celebrated as the Empire’s greatest hero. Alexion’s true nature is fully revealed: wielding the power of Nyx, he intends not merely to rule Mycenae, but to conquer all Pelagon and defy the Myrion themselves. <strong>Eirene</strong>, god of harmony, confronts Alexion in an attempt to mollify the blood-drunk usurper. She is brutally slain, her death marking the final rupture between gods and mortals.</p>
            <p>As Alexion’s ritual unfolds, a deeper paradox comes to light. Alexion’s plan relies upon Alexander’s latent power, drawn across time to anchor the summoning of Nyx-Manifest: the living embodiment of darkness. In resisting Alexion, Alexander unwittingly fulfills the conditions that make the ritual possible. <strong>Atropos</strong>, Weaver of Destiny’s End, moves to halt Alexion herself and sever the loop at its source, yet falters at the final moment, unable to bring herself to end her son’s life. Resigned, she allows the fate she was sworn to cut to unfold once more, condemning herself to witness the cycle repeat. <strong>Phanes</strong>, Unveiler of Truths, stands witness, ensuring that the truth of this cycle is not undone. <strong>Helios</strong> confronts the party as an agent of divine order, judging the time-displaced siblings themselves to be the true destabilizing force. Believing that removing them from the timeline is the last remaining means of averting the Sundering, he moves to expel them by force. The party fights in self-defense, steadfast in their resolve to stop Alexion. Helios is defeated, withdrawing as the world slips beyond the his control.</p>
            <p>The party confronts Alexion within the <strong>Arteries of Nyx</strong>, a spreading, transdimensional vascular lattice where Nyx’s influence bleeds through reality and entwines the city from within. As the battle turns and Nyx’s presence spills through the city, both <strong>Archimedes and Ianthe sacrifice themselves</strong> to keep the siblings alive and to carry the fight through its final, desperate phases. The siblings defeat Alexion, ending his coup, but too late to halt the summoning he has set in motion. From the darkness between space and time emerges <strong>Nyx-Manifest</strong>, whose arrival triggers the <strong>Great Sundering</strong>. Land, sea, and sky fracture as Pelagon is torn apart, and Alexander and Isadora bear witness to cataclysm as they perish in a maelstrom of Nyxian fire. </p>

                <p>
                    In the aftermath, the continent of Pelagon is shattered and civilization lies in ruin. In an epilogue, it is revealed that, years earlier, Phanes, Unveiler of Truths, secreted a bastard child of Alexion to the provincial village of Lysara, preserving Alexion's bloodline beyond the impending Sundering. From this hidden lineage are born Alexander and Isadora: heirs and harbingers of catastrophe.

            <h2>Cast</h2>
            <h3 id="heroes">Heroes</h3>

            <p><b>Alexander</b> - <i>Heir of Alexion, Warrior of Shadow</i><br>
            <u>Role:</u> Protagonist<br>
            <u>Affinity:</u> Shadow (Nyx)<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Deeply anxious yet unmistakably brave, Alexander is haunted by whispers of his Mycenaean heritage. He begins as a humble villager but grows into a legendary warrior as he uncovers the secrets of his bloodline. Despite self-doubt, his courage and sense of justice never waver.<br>
            <u>Combat Style:</u> Alexander serves as a reliable frontline combatant and battlefield anchor, specializing in high multi-target physical damage and party-wide defensive maneuvers. When drawing upon Nyx, Alexander gains overwhelming elemental dominance and burst potential, but at severe personal cost, rapidly depleting his HP and MP reserves and leaving him dangerously exposed if misused.<br>
            <u>Signature Abilities:</u> <strong>Nyxian Slash</strong> – a powerful shadow strike that hits multiple foes; <strong>Phalanx Guard</strong> – a defensive stance that reduces damage taken by the entire party.
</p>

            <p><b>Isadora</b> - <i>Heir of Alexion, Warrior of Light</i><br>
            <u>Role:</u> Co-protagonist<br>
            <u>Affinity:</u> Light (Aither)<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Intuitive, composed, and fiercely protective of her brother, Isadora balances Alexander’s anxiety with measured resolve. A prodigious student of arcane lore, she approaches magic as both discipline and inquiry, uncovering forgotten traditions and lost techniques as readily as she masters them. While quieter than her brother, her presence is stabilizing and decisive.<br>
            <u>Combat Style:</u> Isadora functions as a highly adaptable single-target, elemental caster and primary support specialist, with a pronounced aptitude for Aither-based restorative magic. She provides party-wide healing, wards, and stabilization while channeling multiple elemental schools to exploit enemy weaknesses. As the party’s sole innate wielder of <strong>Aither</strong>, she is especially effective against Nyx-aligned foes; however, this attunement comes at a cost. Her heightened sensitivity to elemental forces renders her uniquely vulnerable to the four primary elements (Gē, Hydōr, Aēr, Pyr).<br>
            <u>Signature Abilities:</u> <strong>Aitheric Veil</strong> – a party-wide enchantment that grants resistance to Nyx-based damage; <strong>Elemental Rapture</strong> – a costly, high-impact spell that compresses multiple elemental forces into a single devastating strike.</p>

            <p><b>Nereus</b> - <i>Historian, Hydōrmancer</i><br>
            <u>Role:</u> Scholar and healer<br>
            <u>Affinity:</u> Water (Hydōr)<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Calm, contemplative, and deeply learned, Nereus is an Ionian Hydōrmancer devoted to the lost histories of Mycenae. He possesses a powerful attunement to water and his robes, woven from  Ionian silk, shimmer perpetually with droplets of seawater.<br>
            <u>Combat Style:</u> Nereus operates as a backline support caster, balancing restorative magic with debilitating debuffs. His Hydōr-based spells specialize in healing, cleansing, and the unraveling of enemy enchantments, while also allowing him to weaken or erode fire-based foes.<br>
            <u>Signature Abilities:</u> <strong>Tide Mend</strong> – a restorative spell that heals allies and removes harmful debuffs; <strong>Drowning Hex</strong> – a water curse that weakens enemy defenses and disrupts ongoing enchantments.

</p>

            <p><b>Ianthe</b> - <i>Aeolian Rogue, Aēromancer</i><br>
            <u>Role:</u> Thief and heavy-hitter<br>
            <u>Affinity:</u> Air (Aēr)<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Brash, quick-witted, and fiercely independent, Ianthe hails from the cliff-top cities of Aeolia. Known for her violet hair and near-weightless grace, she moves with a speed honed by a life of risk and opportunism. Though initially driven by self-interest and survival, she gradually embraces the bonds of the party, trading solitude for loyalty.<br>
            <u>Combat Style:</u>  Ianthe excels as a high damage striker focused on precision and single-target elimination. Her swift, wind-infused attacks exploit can incapacitate priority targets before they act. When her strikes land effectively — especially against earth foes — she generates additional <strong>Actions</strong>, allowing skilled players to chain attacks and maintain offensive momentum.<br>
            <u>Signature Abilities:</u> <strong>Aeolian Subterfuge</strong> – a lightning-fast, wind-infused strike that grants additional actions on a successful hit, with further rewards for exploiting weaknesses; <strong>Steal</strong> – pilfers items and rare Badges from enemies, making Ianthe the party’s primary means of acquiring hidden and powerful equipment.</p>

            <p><b>Archimedes</b> – <i>Attian Sorcerer, Picarro</i><br>
            <u>Role:</u> High-offense sorcerer<br>
            <u>Affinity:</u> Fire (Pyr), Earth (Gē), Water (Hydōr)<br>
            <u>Description:</u> Flamboyant, arrogant, and undeniably brilliant, Archimedes is a politically ambitious sorcerer from Attia, groomed from youth to excel as both orator and spellcaster. His education spans the academies of Attia, the fortified strongholds of Doria, and the scholarly halls of Ionia, granting him rare mastery over multiple elemental traditions. Though his braggadocio frequently clashes with the party’s more earnest members, his intellect and raw power cannot be dismissed.<br>
            <u>Combat Style:</u> Archimedes functions as devastating magical artillery, specializing in high-cost, high-impact area-of-effect spells capable of annihilating enemy groups. His most powerful incantations require significant preparation, often demanding multiple <strong>Actions</strong>, leaving him vulnerable without protection. With low defense, he relies heavily on allies to shield him while he prepares his spells, but when his magic is unleashed, the results are catastrophic.<br>
            <u>Signature Abilities:</u> <strong>Helion’s Breath</strong> – a catastrophic fire incantation that engulfs all enemies in flames; <strong>Seismos</strong> – an earth-shattering spell that fractures the ground beneath foes; <strong>Lash of Io</strong> – a torrential water spell striking all enemies. 
</p>

            <p><b>Alexion</b> - <i>Primary Antagonist, Demigod Son of Atropos</i><br>
            <u>Description:</u> Mythologized as Mycenae’s last great champion, Alexion is revealed as the architect of its ruin. Corrupted by Nyx, he pursues a world remade in his own image and becomes the hidden progenitor of Alexander and Isadora’s bloodline, binding the protagonists to his malignant legacy.</p>

            <p><b>Nyx-Manifest</b> - <i>Final Adversary, Goddess of Darkness</i><br>
            <u>Description:</u> The metaphysical embodiment of darkness. Nyx-Manifest is Alexion’s rebellion incarnate. Defeating her completes the closed time loop and frames the ending/New Game+.</p>
