            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p><strong>Return to Mycenae</strong> is a role-playing game set in a world deeply rooted in Greek mythology and history, combining an intricately plotted narrative with strategically challenging combat systems. The game follows siblings <strong>Alexander</strong> and <strong>Isadora</strong>, rumored descendants of the last hero of the ancient <strong>Mycenaean Empire</strong> (<strong>Alexion</strong>), as they uncover the buried secrets of their bloodline and the remnants of that bygone civilization. Their journey spans the fractured realms of <strong>Pelagon</strong> – from the scholarly coasts of Ionia to the windswept plateaus of Aeolia, the mountain strongholds of Doria, and the pristine marble forums of Attia – ultimately leading to a fateful return through time to the lost city of <strong>Mycenae</strong>.</p>
        
            <p>Inspired by classic SNES-era JRPGs—most notably <i>Final Fantasy IV</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>VI</i> — <i>Return to Mycenae</i> seeks to capture the spirit of epic storytelling, memorable character-driven narratives, and the strategic, turn-based combat that defined the golden age of the genre.</p>

            <p>Gameplay features an <strong>Action Pool System (APS)</strong> where the player’s party and enemies act in alternating team turns. Each team receives a limited pool of Actions at the start of its turn, and tactical decisions dynamically affect this pool: exploiting elemental weaknesses or landing critical hits can grant extra actions, while hitting resistances or other missteps can penalize the team by consuming additional actions. Combat is further deepened by a <strong>six-element Magic System</strong> interwoven with the APS mechanics and a flexible <strong>Badge System</strong> that lets players customize characters’ elemental affinities and abilities. The design emphasizes strategy and synergy. Players must intelligently leverage elemental affinities, craft suitable Badges, balance party aptitudes, manage scarce mana resource, and coordinate character skills to prevail in battle.</p>

            <p><i>Return to Mycenae</i> is designed to deliver the gameplay depth of <i>Final Fantasy V</i>, encouraging experimentation, clever builds, and true mastery of its systems, while offering a narrative as thematically ambitious and emotionally resonant as <i>Final Fantasy VI</i>. It unfolds in a setting that is both unique and culturally familiar: a reimagined Aegean world where history, myth, magic, and the strange.</p>

            <h2>Setting</h2>
             <p>The story unfolds in the maritime world of Pelagon, a land of fractured kingdoms that echoes a mythic past. Pelagon’s setting draws inspiration from Ancient Greek mythology, history, and culture. Millennia ago, all lands were united under the Mycenaean Empire, but a cataclysm known as the <strong>Great Sundering</strong> shattered the continent of Pelagon, breaking both land and cultural unity, leaving behind only scattered nations and cyclopean ruins – silent reminders of an age swallowed by calamity.</p>

            <p>Pelagon is divided into four distinct nations, each carrying the elemental legacy of the lost Mycenaean Empire:</p>

            <ul class="triangle-list left-triangle-list">
                <li><strong>Aeolia</strong>: A scattered archipelago of towering cliffs, windswept plateaus, and half-mad oracles. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Air – Aēr – Ψ</i>)</li>
                <li><strong>Attia</strong>: A densely populated region of exuberant cities, marble-spired palaces, and urban intrigue. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Fire – Pyr – Φ</i>)</li>
                <li><strong>Doria</strong>: A mountain enclave of stone fortresses and iron-willed ascetics. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Earth – Gē – Δ</i>)</li>
                <li><strong>Ionia</strong>: A cosmopolitan coast of open harbors, bustling markets, and winding archives. <br>(<i>Elemental Affinity: Water – Hydōr – Ω</i>)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In ages past, these realms were one. <strong>King Polydamas</strong> ruled from the golden citadel of Mycenae until the Great Sundering fractured Pelagon, effectively severing each nation from the other, both culturally and geographically. In the present day, each nation’s culture and magic is tethered to its elemental affinity, while the ruins of Mycenae lie hidden, shrouding ancient secrets.</p>

            <p>Magic in Pelagon draws from six elemental currents: the four Primary Elements (<strong>Air, Fire, Earth, Water</strong>) tied to the regions above, and two Divine Elements — <strong>Light</strong> (<i>Aither</i>) and <strong>Shadow</strong> (<i>Nyx</i>) — which are shrouded in mystery and myth. These elemental forces infuse every aspect of Pelagon’s world, from its geography and politics to each nation's respective superstitions. Mastery of the elements will prove essential as the heroes venture forth, for even the gods themselves are bound by this elemental balance.</p>
