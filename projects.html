            <h2><i><a href="qeret.html">Qeret: A City Module</i></a></h2>

                <p>I began creating Qeret during my final semester of graduate school. In addition to all my scholastic responsibilities, throughout my entire academic tenure I had been consuming a staggering amount of TTRPG books and supplementary materials. At some point, likely in the dead of night, I decided, quite imprudently, to make my own game. I was tremendously busy for the next six months. I would research and write for school. Nap. Research and write for Qeret. Then back to schoolwork. Qeret. School. Elden Ring came out? Fuck. It was an unhinged chapter of my life, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the hell out of it.</p>

                <p>The driving force behind Qeret was a keen desire to create a tabletop setting based on the Bronze Age Near East: a historical period that is woefully underrepresented in gaming and in broader pop culture. Who isn’t, at least somewhat, excited by the Pyramids of Giza, the Trojan War, Babylon, etc.? I love all history, but I reserve a special place in my heart for that (rather large) slice. In fact, I had, for a brief time, entertained the idea of being a professional Assyriologist or classicist. However, my love for fiction and storytelling pushed me in a different direction. I think I may have created Qeret as a channel to indulge this interest while still pursuing my true calling of narrative.</p>

                <p>Initially, Qeret was going to be a fantasy setting. After all, I love fantasy. Steven Erikson’s <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> and Martin’s <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> are, to me, some of the best pieces of contemporary literature and should, I feel, be unabashedly embraced into the Western canon. So, I put pencil to paper and started writing about magical silt in the alluvial plains of southern Mesopotamia... and no. Something was off. It felt wrong. It felt tired. The world already has fantasy games, I considered. It already has historical fantasy games. And in terms of Bronze Age-inspired fantasy worlds, it already has Glorantha! No, I needed something else. I wanted — nay, I NEEDED — science fiction. After all, I knew that while I may love fantasy, I am infatuated with sci-fi.</p>

                <p>The pivot happened rather quickly after that. It was a flurry of historical research combined with my sifting through an extensive library of sci-fi novels and comics, mining them for inspiration. I wanted to create a setting that had an intimate connection to our historical Bronze Age without being a slavish recreation. And I wanted the science fiction elements to be fun, engaging, and to lie somewhere closer to (though still comfortably distant from) Greg Egan on the Lucas-Egan spectrum of the genre.</p>

                <p>Six months and several hundred thousand words later, I had enough material to start piecing together my first TTRPG setting guide. After graduation, I picked up two jobs, one as a copy editor and one as a bookseller. But my work on Qeret (and my other projects) continued. I now have a substantial portion of Qeret completed and am gradually bringing each chapter to my portfolio. For ease of use, I am developing a glossary (the Qereti Codex) that grows as each chapter is brought online. Qeret is my greatest project (thus far), and I am tremendously proud of it.</p>

             <h2><i><a href="endless-summer.html">Endless Summer</i></a></h2>

                <p><i>Endless Summer</i> is a work-in-progress hard science-fiction novel. The aim of this novel is to blend the mind-bending, galactically sized ideas typical of the best works of science fiction with the historical, philosophical, and emotional depth of a Borges short story or Márquez’s <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>. It is the story of all time and all reality. It follows humanity from its first empire in northern Mesopotamia in the third millennium BCE to the universe’s eventual death trillions of years in the future.</p>

                <p>One night, about five years ago, I spent the evening reading a 2017 astrobiology paper concerning a potential solution to the Fermi Paradox. I’m not a physicist or a cosmologist, but what I gleaned from the paper was fascinating. The solution proposed that sufficiently advanced civilizations might opt to aestivate during the current chapter of the universe’s life; aestivation in earthly biology refers to an animal sleeping through the summer (as opposed to hibernating through winter). The logic behind this move would be to sleep while the universe is still “hot” and wait for it to cool. During this aestivating period, a civilization might accumulate energy and resources for later use. When the universe cools sufficiently, energy efficiency increases dramatically, allowing for potentially greater computational output. This civilization could then awaken and take advantage of this quirk of thermodynamic laws to, perhaps, create nearly endless, nearly infinite simulations. Functionally, they would be immortal. An endless summer, if you will.</p>

                <p>The following morning, as I was preparing to leave for school, the story came to me. I imagined humanity at the tail-end of this Aestivation Hypothesis — after they had slept, after they had awoken to a dead ghostly universe, after truly countless years of living via simulation, and reliving, and reliving, and reliving. The idea seemed both magnificent and terribly bleak. But how did humanity arrive at this point? Surely there would be extended episodes of debate, consternation, and fracture; vast epochs of human time leading to such an extreme form of existence. So, I started constructing my alternate history. There would be the primeval origin of human history (real-world history), advancement, evolution, the digitization of life, exploration, the discovery of alien life, the collision of galaxies, and finally the precipitous moment of aestivation. All experience that followed would be a simulacrum, a specter of life itself, intended to occupy time until time itself unraveled.</p>

                <p>I began plotting Endless Summer in earnest while rereading <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> for a course on Chaucer. It occurred to me that frame tales are uniquely capable of delivering both scope and variety. In a frame tale, one can jump through time, space, and even genre, and still deliver a thematically cohesive story. It also suited my narrative quite well: five simulations, five stories of human history that reveal the trajectory of humanity from the rise of its first empire in the northern plains of Mesopotamia, to the collision of the Milky Way with Andromeda, and finally the eerie, never-ending epilogue of the human saga.</p>

                <p>Endless Summer is not yet complete, but I commit time to it every week. I’m a compulsive editor (and re-editor), but as I bring chapters up to a passable state, I add them here to the repository. I plan, someday, to seize the opportunity to publish it.</p>

            <h2><i><a href="imera-age-of-brilliance.html">Imera: Age of Brilliance</i></a></h2>

                <p><i>Imera: Age of Brilliance</i> is a series of pitch documents for a video game concept. This idea came to me in a dream. One in which I was designing a video game... Sometime before the dream, I had recently finished reading <i>The Dark Forest</i> by Liu Cixin, the second entry in his <i>Three-Body Problem</i> trilogy. For those who haven’t read <i>Three-Body</i>, it explores the invasion of Earth by a rival species inhabiting the trinary Alpha Centauri star system. Owing to erratic orbital patterns, this species endured planet-wide cataclysms whenever their home planet drifted too close, too far, or between the three stars of their system. Upon discovering that Earth is an Edenic paradise orbiting a single, stable star, they decide to seize it from humanity. There is much more to the trilogy beyond the invasion story, but that premise serves as the foundation for the narrative. I highly recommend the series to anyone looking for epic sci-fi.</p>

                <p>The story of <i>Imera</i> shares little with <i>Three-Body</i> except for the central conceit that the primary setting, the planet Imera, exists in a trinary star system. Like in <i>Three-Body</i>, Imera is subject to planet-wide extinction every few hundred million years (give or take). From there, I started tailoring the idea to suit my own interests as a video game player. In Imera, each of the three stars grants unique properties tied to its native dimension. One originates from a plane of magic and imbues Imera and its living creatures with magical properties. The second star is similar, but its "magic" resembles the science and technology of a space opera like <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>John Carter</i>. The third star comes from a heavenly plane, where psychopathic angels abound, and a reigning eldritch God of terrible love consumes will and flesh in equal measure. Fun!</p>

                <p>When Imera finds stable orbit around one of the three stars, it adopts the properties of that star. Thus, Imera can become a world of magic, science, or holy horror. In effect, these stars function as genre-stars: the fantasy star, the sci-fi star, and the religious-horror star. Or, if you prefer, the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>-, <i>Star Wars</i>-, and <i>Hellraiser</i>-stars. The juxtaposition between genres, in my mind, should be extreme and disorienting, effectively dismissing parochial concerns of "tonal consistency."</p>

                <p>The story revolves around a singular hero who exists during a waning age of magic on Imera. The magic system is still in the oven (stay tuned!), but broadly speaking, magic is used for traversal and melee combat. Our hero discovers the nature of their planet and the impending disaster as Imera continues to drift from its magic-granting star. They will explore ruins from past human epochs, when Imera orbited the "science-star." In these ruins, the hero will use magic to "charge" technological artifacts. The tech and equipment systems (also in the oven) will largely revolve around utility devices and ranged combat (e.g., laser guns). Finally, remnant angels of the heavenly star will impede the hero’s journey to save Imera. The bestiary will feature a complex hierarchy of angels and other malevolent servants of heaven. Work on the bestiary is well underway.</p>

            <h2><i><a href="song-of-kali-dari.html">A Song for Kali-Dari</i></a></h2>

                <p><i>Kali-Dari</i> is a comic script I wrote out of a desire to write about the Sumerian city of Uruk, the world’s very first city. It is roughly the length of two standard comic issues (50-60 pages total) or, if you prefer, roughly the length of a rather short graphic novel. Beyond the setting, it is also a meditation on ideology, hegemony, and epistemologies. Specifically, I wanted to dwell on the role that systems of knowledge play in perpetuating ideology. Cities, states, and nations rarely exert themselves without dutiful justification and ideological rationalization.</p>

                <p>It doesn’t take a particularly cynical historian to point out that Ancient Mesopotamian ideologies at the dawn of mankind very conveniently enforced systems of coercion, social stratification, and conquest that had not existed (at least not to that degree) before the development of civilization. It takes a more cynical historian (although only slightly) to posit that many ideologies have filled that role for all of human history. Whether it be Pharaonic rule, caste systems, Manifest Destiny, or slavery, civilization often entwines its modes of operation with its ideologies. In other words, ideology often — perhaps always, according to some — justifies a status quo or state policy.</p>

                <p>But is there knowledge without a system? Is there ideology outside of the boundaries of the urban polity? We live and breathe ideology; it is largely inescapable in the modern world. Kali-Dari explores the confrontation of an emissary of ideology with a world that defies that ideology’s categories and presumptions: epistemology vs. knowledge; a system of understanding vs. understanding itself. The first we create to compel, the second we do instinctively.</p>

                <p>In a pithier summary, <i>Kali-Dari</i>, is about the unraveling of ideology at the dawn of time. It’s about ancients that behaved nothing like us, yet were. And it’s that human element we must cleave to when assessing the ancient past. Too easy it is to recognize the differences while ignoring the similarities. After all, the foundations of Uruk — urban living, accounting, taxation, subjugation, war, conquest, slavery, religion, governance — all of these things remain with us today. Many speak of American or Chinese hegemonic spheres in the modern era. But I suspect if we were visited by intelligent aliens, and they were to weigh us in the balance, they would speak of a world enveloped by an Uruk system: the quintessential human ideology.</p>
