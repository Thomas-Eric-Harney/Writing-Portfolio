        <p>Qeret's economy rests on a foundation of shipbuilding, textiles, and manufacturing, each bolstered by technological innovations drawn from the <strong>Ark</strong>. The <strong>Erutian Harbor</strong> and <strong>Gate of Wheat</strong> handle an unceasing flow of goods; markets like the <strong>Nonagon</strong> throng with merchants and traders; and the factories along the <strong>Bridleway</strong>, worked largely by slaves, churn out clothing, tools, and machinery. Maritime industries continue to dominate, but the city's prosperity depends equally on the labor of its citizenry: from the coopers in <strong>The Anchor</strong> to the merchant magnates of <strong>Libnaan’s Bounty</strong>, it is the collective industry of its people that sustains Qeret’s growth and influence.</p>

        <h2>The Workshop and Ark Industry</h2>
        <p>The Workshop, nestled within the <strong>Ark Sector</strong>, serves as an Ark factory and primary research facility of <strong>the Institute</strong>, where innovation moves faster than caution. It produces essential devices such as <i>prompters</i>, <i>Ark tablets</i>, and <i>servitors</i>, supplying much of the city’s basic amenities. Yet it is the Workshop’s spirit of fearless experimentation that defines its character: a crucible where bold research often outpaces the boundaries of convention. Under the permissive stewardship of its senior researcher, <strong>Nadaba</strong>, students are pushed toward ever more daring pursuits — so long as their work endangers no lives. Though vital to Qeret’s technological ascendance, the Workshop now finds itself at odds with the <strong>Sodality’s</strong> demand for militarized research and manufacturing, a conflict that continues to strain its founding ethos.</p>
