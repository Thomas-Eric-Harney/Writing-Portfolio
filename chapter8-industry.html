        <p>Qeret's economy rests on a foundation of shipbuilding, textiles, and manufacturing, each bolstered by technological innovations drawn from the <strong>Ark</strong>. The <strong>Erutian Harbor</strong> and <strong>Gate of Wheat</strong> handle an unceasing flow of goods; markets like the <strong>Nonagon</strong> throng with merchants and traders; and the factories along the <strong>Bridleway</strong>, worked largely by slaves, churn out clothing, tools, and machinery. Maritime industries continue to dominate, but the city's prosperity depends equally on the labor of its citizenry: from the coopers in <strong>The Anchor</strong> to the merchant magnates of <strong>Libnaan’s Bounty</strong>, it is the collective industry of its people that sustains Qeret’s growth and influence.</p>

        <h2>Ark Industry and the Workshop</h2>
        <p>The Workshop, nestled within the <strong>Ark Sector</strong>, serves as an Ark factory and primary research facility of <strong>the Institute</strong>, where innovation moves faster than caution. It produces essential devices such as <i>prompters</i>, <i>Ark tablets</i>, and <i>servitors</i>, supplying much of the city’s basic amenities. Yet it is the Workshop’s spirit of fearless experimentation that defines its character: a crucible where bold research often outpaces the boundaries of convention. Under the permissive stewardship of its senior researcher, <strong>Nadaba</strong>, students are pushed toward ever more daring pursuits — so long as their work endangers no lives. Though vital to Qeret’s technological ascendance, the Workshop now finds itself at odds with the <strong>Sodality’s</strong> demand for militarized research and manufacturing, a conflict that continues to strain its founding ethos.</p>

        <h2>The Bridleway and its Manufactories</h2>
        <p>Bisecting the center of the <strong>Slave Sector</strong> is the Bridleway, which cuts a track through a forest of kilns and bronze-flecked walls, along which slave-drawn carriages haul daily tonnage toward the Nonagon and other waiting markets. Its avenue consists of dozens of manufactories that supply the material economy that underpins labor and domestic life in Qeret. These smoke-choked facilities produce in staggering volume the axles, tongs, barrels, flanges, and all manner of tools necessary for the conducting of agriculture, shipwork, construction, and basic upkeep of Ark infrastructure. The manufactories themselves rely little on Ark technology, but rather traditional fabrication techniques: hammer, lathe, press, and forge. Despite the Bridleway’s vital contributions, its coerced labor, brutal conditions, and prevailing grime render this quarter of Qeret among its most abject and avoided. </p>

        <h2>Dyeing and Qereti Violet</h2>
        <p>Dyeing remains one of Qeret’s oldest and most esteemed industries, with Qereti Violet marking mansions, marketplaces, and <i>bachnals</i> across the city. Extracted from the <i>murex mollusk</i> that clings to the island’s rocky shores, the dye retains its status despite the emergence of cheaper, Ark-derived synthetic pigments. Often arrayed alongside crimson and cerulean — symbols of the <strong>Bamati Plains</strong> and the <strong>Cerulean Sea</strong> — Qereti Violet remains the foremost symbol of Qereti tradition and prestige. Dyers, ranging from independent artisans to large workshops, are a common sight in the Slave Sector, while newly established synthetic dye houses in the Ark Sector increasingly challenge this traditional trade.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Metallurgy</h2>
            <p>Metallurgy has deep roots in <strong>Adoniah</strong>, its traditions stretching back millennia before the Ark’s arrival. While the Adonian mainland is blessed with an abundance of copper, other metal resources such as tin and lead remain scarce, making Qeret’s industry heavily dependent on imports from <strong>Combassyia</strong> and <strong>Netusha</strong>. Yet, despite this reliance, the craft remains a popular art form as much as a necessity. Traditional methods endure yet in the Bridleway and the smithies of the <strong>Arsenal</strong>, with ores ground into fine powder, fired in terracotta ovens, and poured as molten streams into intricate molds. Qereti metalworkers excel in their techniques — filigreeing, graining, encrusting — transforming raw metal into works of exquisite beauty and precision. Among these artisans, none are more esteemed than <strong>Glaatas</strong>, a Netushan smith whose workshop, <strong>Tools of Glaatas</strong>, stands at the heart of the Arsenal. Merging ancient Netushan techniques with popular Qereti embellishments, Glaatas crafts weapons of exceptional quality. With the assistance of servitors, his forge even produces Ark-hybrid armaments for warriors seeking an edge on the battlefield.</p>

        <h2>The Shipyard</h2>
            <p>The Adonians are renowned for their unparalleled shipbuilding, and indeed it stands as the cornerstone of Qereti industry and the backbone of the city's maritime power. Within the Arsenal, the Shipyard hums with the rhythm of saws and hammers, where shipwrights and caulkers craft vessels of singular precision. Merchant galleys, fishing skiffs, and warships are shaped from expertly cut oak and cedar, fastened with mortise-and-tenon joints and bound by bronze nails. These designs — refined over centuries — meld seamlessly with Ark innovations: synthetic ship wax renders hulls impermeable and impervious to decay, while water-propelled <i>márashes</i> drive ships at tremendous speeds. The result is a fleet rivaled by few across the Cerulean Sea.</p>

            <p>At the <strong>Shipyard's</strong> heart, master shipwrights direct teams of apprentices and laborers, while Ark engineers oversee the integration of alien technology. Hulls are carved with the likenesses of <strong>Zet-Ra</strong> and <strong>Dagon</strong>, gods of the sea and prosperity, respectively, invoking their favor with every voyage. Trade galleys boast figureheads wrought by Qeret’s finest sculptors, while <strong>Admiralty</strong> warships bristle with particle hammers: sleek, lethal, and highly proprietary.</p>

        <h2>Textiles and Fashion</h2>
            <p>Within the Slave Sector, textile mills, operated largely by the city’s sizable slave population, produce essential fabrics like wool and linen to clothe the masses. The city’s enduring passion for textiles extends beyond mere utility, however, to impressive displays of cultural artistry. In the affluent district of <strong>Dagon’s Respite</strong>, opulent fabrics woven from <strong>Léusian</strong> silk, taffeta, and fine combed flax are crafted with painstaking care. These luxury textiles, often limned with shimmering decorative <i>skeins</i> known as “<i>weavings</i>,” cater exclusively to the city’s elite. Cloaks, gowns, tunics, robes, and mantles woven in Dagon’s Respite are prized the world over, their intricate designs and radiant colors symbols of Qereti high fashion.</p>

            <p>Moreover, there exists high demand for clothing that emulates the styles of other influential cities — namely, <strong>Makar</strong>, <strong>Lux</strong>, and <strong>Lusawat</strong> — each equally renowned for their sartorial customs. Qereti tailors are unmatched in their ability to replicate these foreign fashions, though in certain circles, donning such imitations is considered quite gauche.</p>

        <h2>Trader's Guild</h2>
        <p>Guilds form the backbone of Qeret’s industry, their influence felt in every workshop, market, harbor, and factory. At their apex rests the <strong>Trader’s Guild</strong> — a guild of guilds — that knits together the brewers, dockworkers, shipwrights, armorers, dyers, and a dozen other professional associations into one sprawling, labyrinthine body. From the expansive Guild House in <strong>Libnaan’s Bounty</strong>, its stewards declare edicts, set prices, and enforce standards to ensure Qereti industry remains even keeled and profitable. Democracy, they claim, governs the Guild, but the truth is a mire of petty rivalries, whispered bargains, and knife-edge compromises. Guild leaders such as the <strong>Makarian</strong> spice merchant, Adanoab, speak of labor reforms and rights hard-won, yet many know the Guild’s fist just as well as its open hand. </p>
