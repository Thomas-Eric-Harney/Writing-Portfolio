        <p>Qeret's economy rests on a foundation of shipbuilding, textiles, and manufacturing, each bolstered by technological innovations drawn from the <strong>Ark</strong>. The <strong>Erutian Harbor</strong> and <strong>Gate of Wheat</strong> handle an unceasing flow of goods; markets like the <strong>Nonagon</strong> throng with merchants and traders; and the factories along the <strong>Bridleway</strong>, worked largely by slaves, churn out clothing, tools, and machinery. Maritime industries continue to dominate, but the city's prosperity depends equally on the labor of its citizenry: from the coopers in <strong>The Anchor</strong> to the merchant magnates of <strong>Libnaan’s Bounty</strong>, it is the collective industry of its people that sustains Qeret’s growth and influence.</p>

        <h2>Ark Industry and the Workshop</h2>
        <p>The Workshop, nestled within the <strong>Ark Sector</strong>, serves as an Ark factory and primary research facility of <strong>the Institute</strong>, where innovation moves faster than caution. It produces essential devices such as <i>prompters</i>, <i>Ark tablets</i>, and <i>servitors</i>, supplying much of the city’s basic amenities.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup> Yet it is the Workshop’s spirit of fearless experimentation that defines its character: a crucible where bold research often outpaces the boundaries of convention. Under the permissive stewardship of its senior researcher, <strong>Nadaba</strong>, students are pushed toward ever more daring pursuits — so long as their work endangers no lives. Though vital to Qeret’s technological ascendance, the Workshop now finds itself at odds with the <strong>Sodality’s</strong> demand for militarized research and manufacturing, a conflict that continues to strain its founding ethos.</p>

        <h2>The Bridleway and its Manufactories</h2>
        <p>Bisecting the center of the <strong>Slave Sector</strong> is the Bridleway, which cuts a track through a forest of kilns and bronze-flecked walls, along which slave-drawn carriages haul daily tonnage toward the Nonagon and other waiting markets. Its avenue consists of dozens of manufactories that supply the material economy that underpins labor and domestic life in Qeret. These smoke-choked facilities produce in staggering volume the axles, tongs, barrels, flanges, and all manner of tools necessary for the conducting of agriculture, shipwork, construction, and basic upkeep of Ark infrastructure. The manufactories themselves rely little on Ark technology, but rather traditional fabrication techniques: hammer, lathe, press, and forge. Despite the Bridleway’s vital contributions, its coerced labor, brutal conditions, and prevailing grime render this quarter of Qeret among its most abject and avoided. </p>

        <h2>Trader's Guild</h2>
        <p>Guilds form the backbone of Qeret’s industry, their influence felt in every workshop, market, harbor, and factory. At their apex rests the <strong>Trader’s Guild</strong> — a guild of guilds — that knits together the brewers, dockworkers, shipwrights, armorers, dyers, and a dozen other professional associations into one sprawling, labyrinthine body. From the expansive Guild House in <strong>Libnaan’s Bounty</strong>, its stewards declare edicts, set prices, and enforce standards to ensure Qereti industry remains even keeled and profitable. Democracy, they claim, governs the Guild, but the truth is a mire of petty rivalries, whispered bargains, and knife-edge compromises. Guild leaders such as the <strong>Makarian</strong> spice merchant, <strong>Adanoab</strong>, speak of labor reforms and rights hard-won, yet many know the Guild’s fist just as well as its open hand. </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Dyeing and Qereti Violet</h2>
        <p>Dyeing remains one of Qeret’s oldest and most esteemed industries, with Qereti Violet marking mansions, marketplaces, and <i>bachnals</i> across the city. Extracted from the <i>murex mollusk</i> that clings to the island’s rocky shores, the dye retains its status despite the emergence of cheaper, Ark-derived synthetic pigments. Often arrayed alongside crimson and cerulean — symbols of the <strong>Bamati Plains</strong> and the <strong>Cerulean Sea</strong> — Qereti Violet remains the foremost symbol of Qereti tradition and prestige. Dyers, ranging from independent artisans to large workshops, are a common sight in the Slave Sector, while newly established synthetic dye houses in the Ark Sector increasingly challenge this traditional trade.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Metallurgy</h2>
            <p>Metallurgy has deep roots in <strong>Adoniah</strong>, its traditions stretching back millennia before the Ark’s arrival. While the Adonian mainland is blessed with an abundance of copper, other metal resources such as tin and lead remain scarce, making Qeret’s industry heavily dependent on imports from <strong>Combassyia</strong> and <strong>Netusha</strong>. Yet, despite this reliance, the craft remains a popular art form as much as a necessity. Traditional methods endure yet in the Bridleway and the smithies of the <strong>Arsenal</strong>, with ores ground into fine powder, fired in terracotta ovens, and poured as molten streams into intricate molds. Qereti metalworkers excel in their techniques — filigreeing, graining, encrusting — transforming raw metal into works of exquisite beauty and precision. Among these artisans, none are more esteemed than <strong>Glaatas</strong>, a Netushan smith whose workshop, <strong>Tools of Glaatas</strong>, stands at the heart of the Arsenal. Merging ancient Netushan techniques with popular Qereti embellishments, Glaatas crafts weapons of exceptional quality. With the assistance of servitors, his forge even produces Ark-hybrid armaments for warriors seeking an edge on the battlefield.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>The Shipyard</h2>
            <p>The Adonians are renowned for their unparalleled shipbuilding, and indeed it stands as the cornerstone of Qereti industry and the backbone of the city's maritime power. Within the Arsenal, the Shipyard hums with the rhythm of saws and hammers, where shipwrights and caulkers craft vessels of singular precision. Merchant galleys, fishing skiffs, and warships are shaped from expertly cut oak and cedar, fastened with mortise-and-tenon joints and bound by bronze nails. These designs, refined over centuries, meld seamlessly with Ark innovations: synthetic ship wax renders hulls impermeable and impervious to decay, while water-propelled <i>márashes</i> drive ships at tremendous speeds. The result is a fleet rivaled by few across the Cerulean Sea.</p>

            <p>At the <strong>Shipyard's</strong> heart, master shipwrights direct teams of apprentices and laborers, while Ark engineers oversee the integration of alien technology. Hulls are carved with the likenesses of <strong>Zet-Ra</strong> and <strong>Dagon</strong>, gods of the sea and prosperity, respectively, invoking their favor with every voyage. Trade galleys boast figureheads wrought by Qeret’s finest sculptors, while <strong>Admiralty</strong> warships bristle with particle hammers: sleek, lethal, and highly proprietary.</p>

        <h2>Textiles and Fashion</h2>
            <p>Within the Slave Sector, textile mills, operated largely by the city’s sizable slave population, produce essential fabrics like wool and linen to clothe the masses. The city’s enduring passion for textiles extends beyond mere utility, however, to impressive displays of cultural artistry. In the affluent district of <strong>Dagon’s Respite</strong>, opulent fabrics woven from <strong>Léusian</strong> silk, taffeta, and fine combed flax are crafted with painstaking care. These luxury textiles, often limned with shimmering decorative <i>skeins</i> known as “<i>weavings</i>,” cater exclusively to the city’s elite. Cloaks, gowns, tunics, robes, and mantles woven in Dagon’s Respite are prized the world over, their intricate designs and radiant colors symbols of Qereti high fashion.</p>

            <p>Moreover, there exists high demand for clothing that emulates the styles of other influential cities — namely, <strong>Makar</strong>, <strong>Lux</strong>, and <strong>Lusawat</strong> — each equally renowned for their sartorial customs. Qereti tailors are unmatched in their ability to replicate these foreign fashions, though in certain circles, donning such imitations is considered quite gauche.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Slave Trade</h2>
            <p>For over a thousand years, slavery has sustained Qeret’s economy and shaped its social hierarchy. Within the Slave Sector, human chattel are bought and sold to serve every conceivable purpose: as attendants in the <strong>Royal Palace</strong>, as laborers in the furnace-halls of the Bridleway, and even as apprentice shipwrights in the Arsenal. Yet the ancient institution now trembles beneath growing moral scrutiny, as emancipatory movements, foremost among them <strong>Izabel’s Rapture</strong>, gather strength. Led by the eloquent freedwoman <strong>Izabel</strong>, the Rapture demands not reform but total abolition, envisioning a world where labor and bondage are no longer synonymous.</p>

            <p><strong>King Tiraal</strong>, wary of rebellion and constrained not only by tradition but by powerful monied interests, has offered only token gestures: slaves may possess limited personal property and occupy state housing within the Sector. Few regard these as little more than political palliatives. Conditions vary drastically; some slaves live in comparative comfort within their masters’ households (though rarely earning manumission), while others toil to exhaustion in Combassyia’s copper mines or die nameless in its levied armies. As liberationist sentiments wind through Qeret’s streets, the question of slavery’s future looms ever larger.</p>

            <p>Despite public disavowals, the Trader’s Guild profits from coerced labor at every turn. Its delegates speak glibly of reform, yet the manufactories remain as they are, monuments to an economy where every new slave means one fewer job for the free laborer. While the Guild claims to champion the working class, it quietly sustains the system that keeps them underpaid and expendable.</p>

        <h2>Woodworking</h2>
            <p>Mainland Adoniah boasts extensive forests of oak, cedar, and pine, resources integral to Qeret’s woodworking industry. Each is valued differently: cedar from the <strong>Libnush Forest</strong> is reserved primarily for shipbuilding and monumental construction, oak for structural supports and load-bearing architecture, and pine for lesser furnishings and temporary works. Transported across the <strong>Qereti Strait</strong>, this timber supplies Qeret’s carpenters and artisans, who fashion it into everything from furniture to the keels, ribs, and fittings essential to maritime trade.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="back-to-text2">2</a></sup></p>
      
            <p>For municipal projects and the estates of the wealthy, timber is often treated with a specialized <i>Dust</i> glaze, its nanites permeating the grain to greatly retard rot, warping, and age. Such treated wood endures for generations,  while untreated lumber remains the standard for the poor and the provincial.</p>

            Such pedestrian labor is typically assigned to Institute novices or to the servitors themselves. In a grimly efficient arrangement, many Workshop servitors exist for the sole purpose of fabricating additional servitors. Though economically sound, this cycle produces an unintended effect: over time, servitors often develop faint but persistent attachments to their creations, regarding them with a proprietary tenderness that borders on the parental.<a href="#back-to-text1">↩</a>

          <li id="footnote2">
            Two centuries past, Qeret faced the very real prospect of the Libnush Forest’s total deforestation, a collapse that would have beggared the city and crippled its shipbuilding economy. In response, extensive reforestation campaigns were undertaken, aided by advanced agronomist techniques introduced by the Ark aliens. These interventions not only restored the Libnush’s cedar stands but stabilized its surrounding ecologies.<a href="#back-to-text2">↩</a>
