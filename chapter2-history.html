        <h2>Before the Ark</h2>

        <p>
          The world of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#kassatim-entry">Kassatím</a></strong> is old
          and its history reaches back thousands of years. Proto cities first
          emerged in the southern alluvial plains of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#makaria-entry">Makaria</a></strong
          >, and impelled by an extraordinary agricultural revolution, these
          cities began to proliferate and appear across the many regions of
          Kassatím. At these nascent sites early peoples erected monolithic
          structures as tributes to ancient gods, and the written script,
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#crestform-entry">crestform</a></i> —
          employed by imprinting crescent shapes into wet clay — was developed
          to track trade and the ever-rising surpluses of barley, wheat, and
          precious metals. In tandem with these developments, rigid social
          hierarchies arose, and temple administrations took great care to
          control the flow of resources and to efficaciously tax the growing
          urban populations. High priests positioned themselves at the apex of
          these hierarchies, though in time they were replaced by kings — often
          deities in their own right. This stratification of society became
          commonplace as agricultural, artisanal, commercial, and scholarly
          professions continued to emerge.
        </p>

        <p>
          As agricultural advancements disseminated, so too did the practices of
          writing and monumental construction. Many of the other major urbanized
          cultures in Kassatím adopted the crestform script and adapted it to
          their respective tongues. In Makaria, great ziggurats dominated the
          skylines and served as the central administrative and religious hubs
          of each respective city. Outside the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#leu-entry">Léusian</a></strong> hamlet of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#ixia-entry">Ixia</a></strong
          >, five immense limestone pyramids encased in marble were erected in
          the desert in tribute to their divinely appointed kings. As the number
          of cities steadily increased, the world became a greater patchwork of
          budding nations and great wonders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, following centuries of countless wars and territorial
          concessions, six great regional powers emerged in Kassatím: Makaria,
          Léu, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#combassyia-entry">Combassyia</a></strong
          >, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#netusha-entry">Netusha</a></strong>
          >, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#knakros-entry">Knakros</a></strong
          >, and the runt of the six,
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#drys-entry">Drys</a></strong
          >. At the same time,
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#adoniah-entry">Adoniah</a></strong> emerged
          as a loosely connected network of culturally linked yet politically
          independent city-states. Extensive trade routes linked these Kingdoms
          and their vassals, creating a vast interconnected world of flourishing
          commerce and culture. Progress, however, is relative. For little did
          the myriad people of Kassatím know, their many accomplishments were
          soon to be dwarfed.

        <h2>The Ark</h2>

        <p>
          The Ark’s origins are shrouded in mystery. Propelled by a silent,
          unnamed, unseen, and inscrutable intelligence, this gargantuan space
          vessel traveled through the galaxy for uncounted eons. However, the
          Ark was not aimless, as it often directed itself to worlds that stood
          at the brink of disaster. Supernovas, apocalyptic wars, rampant
          disease, among myriad other calamities, often leave civilizations on
          the verge of annihilation. It was at these times, as civilizations
          faced their impending destruction, that the Ark would appear, waiting
          to accept the refugees who sought to live another day. Through
          countless cycles, the Ark embraced hundreds of alien species from
          across the galaxy. It graciously accommodated these wretched beings,
          supplying not only a home, but all the necessities each required to
          live. Its motivations and purposes, however, remained elusive. To this
          day the Ark has never spoken on such matters — assuming, of course, it
          is capable of speech or even thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          There came a time, however, when the Ark’s endless cycle of retrieval
          and nomadism came to an end: the day it arrived on the planet Earth.
          The Ark, seemingly finished with its mission, landed at the center of
          the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#cerulean-entry">Cerulean Sea</a></strong>
          upon the isle of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#dactos-entry">Dactos</a></strong
          >, off the coast of Knakros. Its advanced systems shut down,
          permanently it would seem, and opened itself to the Edenic world
          outside. After untold generations aboard the Ark, its inhabitants were
          eager to explore this new world. And that they did. In the years
          since, Ark aliens have settled in every city, town, and hinterland of
          Kassatím.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-box" id="overview">
        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>What does the Ark look like?</u></h3>

        <p>
          The Ark is black as onyx, though the composition of this dark alloy
          remains a mystery. It stands vertically, reaching eight kilometers
          into the sky, making it the tallest peak in the known world. As such,
          the higher one navigates its labyrinthian halls and stories the less
          natural oxygen one can breathe. At its rectangular base it is two
          kilometers wide. On most days only its bottom half may be seen, as the
          rest towers well above the clouds. Its structure is non-uniform, with
          concavities, convexities, and sharp angles running up its length. On a
          clear day the Ark can be seen from Qeret and many other major cities
          along the coast of the Cerulean. Looming dark in the distance, the Ark
          is a foreboding sight indeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the years since its arrival, the wildlife and plant life of Dactos
          has begun to encroach into its cavernous and dormant interiors.
          Despite its current desolate state, the Ark still attracts a steady
          stream of tourists. The few people that call the Ark home are scholars
          who seek to riddle the true nature of the Ark and its inscrutable
          pilot.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Long Century of Integration</h2>

        <p>
          In the century following the arrival of the Ark, a long period of Ark
          alien migration and integration followed. This period was not fraught
          with war, as you might expect. The Ark aliens largely came in peace
          and were generally accepted by humanity. Initially, many perceived the
          Aliens as deities. This should come as no surprise, considering the
          Ark aliens descended from the skies and wielded technology that
          appeared assuredly divine. Nonetheless, in time, it became apparent
          that these new arrivals were not gods or angels or spirits, but simply
          other living beings — albeit exceptionally exotic living beings.
          Further, it was the material offerings of these Ark aliens that most
          ingratiated them to their hosts, as to turn away these migrants meant
          turning away their gifts as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          As such, the most immediate and dynamic change that the Long Century
          of Integration brought to Kassatím was not the introduction of the Ark
          aliens themselves but rather their advanced technologies. Their tools
          and sciences were as useful as they were spectacular: micron lasers
          that could slice and carve marble in a fraction of the time it would
          take to chisel;
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#fertilizerpod-entry"
              >fertilizer pods</a
            ></strong
          >
          that could replenish entire swaths of barren land; bionic implants
          known as
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#prompter-entry">prompters</a></strong> that
          enabled instant cross-cultural and inter-species communication;
          particle physics that allowed entangled communication across vast
          distances. Rapidly the world of Kassatím became woven with threads of
          Ark alien technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          The product of this union is a magnificent amalgam of these two
          disparate mega-cultures. Entire Makarian ziggurats are laced with
          highly magnetic
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#skein-entry">skeins</a></i> that allow
          them to float serenely in the sky. Humans walk the streets of Lux with
          neural implants that enable them to witness announcements descended
          from the great democratic machine-pyramids of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#lux-entry">Lux</a></strong
          >. Promptly, the wedging of clay tablets with crestform became an
          obsolete method of record keeping, as digital
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#arktablet-entry">Ark tablets</a></strong>
          allowed information to be stored virtually and indefinitely. Further,
          Ark alien philosophies and ideologies have caused an unprecedented
          shift in the popular imagination, as secularist, existentialist, and
          even anarchist ideologies have become accepted by a growing number of
          humans. It was a renaissance of culture and science on an
          unprecedented scale. Now, the comparatively primitive humans are like
          children in a sandbox of wonder, though their understanding grows with
          each passing generation and in increasingly greater strides.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naturally, the scholars, priests, and scientists of Kassatím resolved
          to begin a new calendar with the Ark’s arrival, marking its
          inauguration as Year 1, A.A. (After Ark). Scholars have since agreed
          that the subsequent Long-Century ended when an
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#ichor-entry">ichor</a></i> — known to
          most as simply <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#zet-entry">Zet</a></strong> —
          ascended the throne of Netusha in the year 112 A.A.: a historic
          occasion that signaled an end to the era of integration, and the start
          of a new age of seamless human and Ark alien cohabitation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Present Day</h2>

        <p>
          It is now the year 284 A.A. and roughly ten human generations have
          passed since the arrival of the Ark. Most scholars agree that Kassatím
          has entered a golden age. Starvation and famine have ceased to be a
          concern for the majority, as advanced agronomic technologies have
          created unprecedented surpluses of staple cereals, ensuring that
          nearly all are well-fed. Ark alien medicine has eliminated most major
          diseases and no longer do cities worry over seasonal plagues and
          unseen ailments. While day-to-day survival and subsistence had once
          been a chief concern for most, now the noble causes of exploration,
          development, and progress excite the imaginations of millions.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, though civilization may thrive, not all is well in Kassatím.
          Warfare persists, as the introduction of advanced Ark alien weaponry
          sparked a perpetual arms race that dominates the concerns of most
          leaders. Internal social and political revolutions loom over most
          major cities, as Ark alien knowledge has caused many to question the
          validity of religious and governmental control. Factions — major and
          minor, local and global — vie for control of the many cities,
          kingdoms, and trade routes of the world. The world of Kassatím teeters
          on the edge. Will the cultures of Kassatím transcend and become
          another of the great galactic civilizations? Or will it be consumed by
          its own unchecked ambition?

        <h2>A History of Adoniah</h2>

        <p>
          In addition to the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#greatkingdoms-entry">Great Kingdoms</a></strong> of Kassatím, there is the disunified
          assemblage of city-states known as Adoniah. Adonian cities such as
          Qeret, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#taath-entry">Taath</a></strong
          >, and <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#erutu-entry">Erutu</a></strong> share
          common origins, and though independently governed, also share a common
          religious pantheon, language, architectural style, and mode of dress.
          A highly fractious culture, Adoniah does not compare to great kingdoms
          such as Léu and Combassyia in terms of military power. Rather, Adonian
          cities exercise economic influence through trade and cultural
          influence through the arts. Adoniah is a merchant culture grown rich
          by its trade routes across the Cerulean, particularly those that bring
          goods from Drys, Léu, and Knakros to Netusha and the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#twinrivers-entry">Twin Rivers</a></strong
          >. Adonian cities such as Qeret and Erutu serve as locus points of
          trade that enable each of the great kingdoms, in turn, to thrive
          commercially, making these Adonian sites crucial elements in the
          international trade-network of Kassatím.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Adonian people emerged in the southern alluvial plains of Makaria
          as a distant cousin to the Makarians. From the outset, the Adonian
          people were industrious and insatiably curious. Eschewing war and
          conflict, the Adonians leaned towards commerce. Following a widespread
          exodus — spurred by the calamitous and widespread salinization of
          their native land — the Adonians migrated west, eventually settling in
          the coastal region now known as
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#mainlandadoniah-entry"
              >Mainland Adoniah</a
            ></strong
          >. It was then that the first Adonian city, Qeret, was founded, though
          the Erutians claim this milestone as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the centuries following, the Adonians began to innovate culturally.
          They were the first culture to develop an
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#adonianalphabet-entry">alphabet</a></i
          >: the most notable alternative to the ancient logo-syllabic script
          known as crestform. While crestform remains the dominant form of
          writing in Makaria, Combassyia, and Netush — and the ever-iconoclastic
          Léusians juggle no less than three unique forms of writing — the
          Adonians and other Cerulean cultures such as Drys and Knakros cleave
          to the alphabet. The convenience and relative simplicity of the
          alphabet enabled those traditionally excluded from literacy to begin
          reading, writing, and corresponding. As a result, a growing class of
          merchants arose: industrious and relentlessly entrepreneurial, this
          upstart sphere of Adonian society only expanded following the arrival
          of the Ark. With new sought after goods, and Ark-enhanced tradeships,
          Adoniah's economic dominance was solidified, forever centering the
          merchant estate in Adonian culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Several hundred years before The Ark’s arrival, the Adonians went
          through an extended age of colonial expansion. The five cities of
          Mainland Adoniah founded “daughter cities” across the Cerulean, which,
          collectively, are referred to as
          <strong
            ><a href="qereti-codex.html#colonialadoniah-entry"
              >Colonial Adoniah</a
            ></strong
          >. Most famous of these colonies is the city of Taath, daughter of
          Qeret, which lies within the borders of Léu. Qeret and Taath are
          closely allied despite residing within the borders of different
          kingdoms. Though the cities of Colonial and Mainland Adoniah are far
          flung, the intricate network of shipping lanes used by the Adonians
          ensures a constant exchange of both information and goods. Indeed, the
          Adonians are known the world over for their immense trading fleets
          that tirelessly ply the Cerulean, connecting the Léusian, Dryic, and
          Knakriti markets to the eastern half of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even before the arrival of the Ark, Adonian society had been among the
          most sophisticated cultures of the Cerulean. Owing to numerous
          technological advancements and lucrative trade routes, Adoniah became
          a diverse, urbanized, widely literate, and highly affluent
          civilization. Indeed, the ubiquity of Adonian commerce positively
          impacted the rest of the world as well. Till the emergence of Adonian
          cities like Qeret, naval networks of trade remained limited in scope,
          often restricted to regional neighbors. It was not until the Adonian
          era of exploration and trade that the great kingdoms formed an
          interstate system of trade, diplomacy, and even war. This economic
          dominance has persisted since the Ark, as Qeret has taken particular
          advantage of Ark-derived propulsion systems known as
          <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#marash-entry">maráshes</a></i> that send
          its trading vessels skimming across the waters of the Cerulean at
          stunning speeds. But though Adoniah thrives commercially and
          technologically, it has never been a unified political entity.
          Tethered by custom rather than leadership, Adonian city-states compete
          economically while sharing a common sense of cultural identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Very rarely has Qeret, or any of the Adonian city-states, been a truly
          sovereign nation. Despite Adoniah’s influence, its cities remain
          relegated to the perpetual status of vassal — owing perhaps to
          Adoniah’s very disunity as a political entity. Over the centuries
          Qeret has changed hands between Léu and Combassyia many times over.
          Each, in turn, demanding stiff tribute and undying loyalty. At the
          present, Qeret owes fealty to Combassyia and its emperor
          <strong

              >Banipahl Byzes</a
