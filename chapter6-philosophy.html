        <p>Before <strong>the Ark</strong>’s arrival, priests and scribes expressed human philosophy, such as it was, by means of elaborate religious epistemologies. However, upon the Ark’s arrival, its inhabitants introduced exotic philosophies and worldviews that fundamentally challenged humanity’s comparably parochial understanding of the universe. Though many humans were initially hesitant to embrace such disruptive ideas, a significant number found them deeply compelling. Novel questions such as, "What does it mean to exist?" "Where does meaning originate?" and "How does one find happiness?" were concerns the Ark aliens had pondered for eons. These inquiries, and the ever-seductive possibility of discerning answers, proved irresistible to many humans. Over the past 284 years, <strong>Kassatím</strong> has experienced a prolonged philosophical awakening. So profound has its impact been that <strong>Dryic</strong> philosophers now refer to this Post-Ark era as the <i>Kosmogonia</i>, or "the birth of order." In Qeret, as in most major cities, a multitude of esoteric philosophies have taken root.</p>

        <h2>Gallianism</h2>

        <p>Gallianism is an egoist philosophical movement named for <strong>Galli</strong>, the Adonian god of pleasure, leisure, and delicacies. Despite the movement's name referencing a human deity, Gallians are staunch atheists and skeptics. Their belief system originated with the <i>ichor</i> <strong>Ruustus</strong> in the year 56 A.A. Though her species was known for its piety, Ruustus renounced these traditions in favor of a radically secular perspective. She began by denying the existence of the soul and the afterlife — a stance that certainly shocked her fellow ichor but had already gained acceptance among many. Ruustus went further, however, arguing that without a soul to maintain, or an afterlife to strive for, all living beings are free from any formal moral responsibility. As such, the only responsibility an individual has is to themselves, and to surrender oneself — our only true possession, she reasoned — to any religion, system, ideology, or dogma is akin to slavery. According to Ruustus, of these, ideology posed the greatest threat to personal fulfillment. In her words, “ideologies are like gods: specters, illusions masquerading as truth.” <sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>Ruustus attracted many followers with her assertion that each individual owes their highest allegiance to themselves. Over the past two centuries, her movement has attracted, above all, hedonists (indeed, it was they, not Ruustus, who linked the movement with Galli). They relish food, song, dance, and art above all else, and many artists in Qeret favor Gallianism for the decadence it enables. Owing to the movement's popularity, artistic depictions of Galli are second only to Nasiru in ubiquity. Once a year, the <strong>Festival of Galli</strong> is celebrated in the streets of Qeret, where Gallians gather to binge drink and indulge in fetes of obscene proportions.</p>

        <p>Yet, despite these egregious displays, the movement's founder remains an anomaly within it. She resides, sequestered, within the halls of the <strong>Bottega</strong>, but curiously does not share the hedonistic proclivities of her followers (though she does not begrudge them their fun). Instead, she prefers to live a life of pensive solitude and strict asceticism — a lifestyle she insists brings her the most personal satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>Searchers of the Lost Bauble</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most peculiar philosophical movement to emerge since the Ark is the loose confederation of fanatics known as the Searchers of the Lost Bauble. According to its members, an object exists, somewhere. that holds the entirety of the universe within its confines. The composition and location of the Bauble are unknown; however, it is widely believed by the Searchers to be a trinket of some sort, with deceptively little to no practical use. It could be a toy horse, a crude figure of twine, or even a nondescript rock resting on a riverbed. Discovery of this unidentified object would, in their eyes, reveal the ultimate truths of existence.</p>
      
        <p>The Searchers insist that, in some primordial epoch and through a great celestial conflagration, all conscious beings were violently severed from the bosom of reality. The cause of this schism, they say, defies understanding. Yet, they claim to grasp the false nature of the reality we now inhabit. Once separated from true existence, life was thrust into non-existence, a vacuous state intrinsically incompatible with sapient perception. Thus, out of necessity, intelligent beings subconsciously, and collectively, conjured a new illusory reality to replace the first. According to the Searchers, reality as we know it is nothing more than an extension of our consciousness — a projection of our insecurities and fears. Further, the original mother-universe, <strong>Tiamuriam</strong>, upon its disappearance, coalesced into a single object and cast itself somewhere into this "no-place" we call reality.</p>
      
        <p>So the Searchers search, hoping to one day locate this universal bauble and be reunited with Tiamuriam. They are not numerous but are easily spotted. Much like the Observers of the Totality, the Searchers spend much of their time looking at things. However, rather than being passive watchers, Searchers enthusiastically interact with an endless succession of objects, hoping to discern any latent "cosmic properties." They root through trash, manhandle market goods, and even ransack private dwellings in their eternal bid to locate the Bauble. In short, they are a nuisance.</p>

        <p>Many scholars have attempted — and failed — to conduct surveys to ascertain the exact origins, tenets, and demographic composition of this odd movement. An astonishingly secretive clan, the Searchers are loath to discuss their convictions with outsiders, owing as much from secrecy as from a sheer disinterest in the immaterial world they call "no-place." The few patient scholars who study the Searchers widely agree that the movement likely originated aboard the Ark, perhaps as a coping mechanism for so many species flirting with apocalypse and near-extinction. They also suspect that, though the Searchers lack any formal organization, there are "Senior Searchers" in every city who loosely direct searching operations for local adherents.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="back-to-text2">2</a></sup></p>

        <h2>Totality</h2>
        <p>Another esoteric movement gaining traction in Qeret is known as the Totality. Its adherents, called the Observers, have committed themselves to observing everything — every object, person, phenomenon, and mundane occurrence. From the pleading of every beggar to the brewing of every beer, the Observers tirelessly and pensively watch. The Totality originated in the venerable halls of <strong>the Institute</strong>, within the <strong>Ark Sector</strong> of Qeret. There, a cadre of scientists, primarily <strong>Vytrim</strong>, specialize in the intricacies of probability. These scientists theorize that any given phenomenon exists, when unobserved, in a state of delicate irresolution in which a subject’s condition is, at a probabilistic level, fundamentally undetermined. In this state of unreality, a subject is neither one thing nor another, but rather, neither. A particle is neither here nor there, a wave nor a particle — until it is observed.</p>

        <p>To illustrate this principle, the renowned Vytrim probabilist, Trystik, popularized a thought experiment since dubbed “Trystik’s Ophidian.” In this hypothetical situation, an ophidian is sealed inside an amphora, its fate unknown to the outside world. Until the amphora is shattered, and the state of the ophidian observed, the wretched creature remains suspended between life and death, its existence a superposition of both. According to <strong>Trystik</strong>, an observation of the amphora’s interior serves as a catalyst for the resolution of probable states. While the ophidian remains in the amphora, it is neither dead nor alive but exists in a state of indeterminacy. The moment of perception resolves this indeterminacy, one way or the other. For some more unconventional scholars, the implication of this thought experiment is that consciousness itself resolves reality. Or put another way: without perception, there is no existence.</p>
        
        <p>For most Qereti, this sort of conceptual bilge holds little interest. However, there have been some profoundly impacted by its perceived implications. Thus emerged the Totality, a philosophy that implores the observation of all things in the hope that reality may be “liberated” from its innate indecision and made truly <i>real</i>. It is a decentralized movement, and its followers scattered across the city. Typically, they subsist as beggars, spending their waking hours observing the obscure, the esoteric, and most of all, the quotidian. It is not uncommon to see an Observer staring into the gutter, leering at oblivious dogs in the street, or people-watching in <strong>the Nonagon</strong>. Some Observers have even committed to plying their trade as they sleep, hoping to observe every inch of life’s dreamscape; adherents to this particular current of the Totality often smoke excessive amounts of <strong>broodweed</strong> plucked in the <strong>Public Gardens</strong>, napping tirelessly beneath the lofty eaves of the <strong>Sky Towers</strong>. Generally speaking, the Observers are a harmless — if a bit nosy — group of eccentrics, often trading precious items in exchange for witnessing novel deeds and actions.</p>

        <h2>The Weave</h2>
        <p>During the Ark's long journey through space, a philosophy known as the Weave became a prominent belief system held by many of the ship's inhabitants. Early in the Ark's transit, the diversity of species aboard created significant issues of communication. Prompters readily enabled inter-special communication, but curiously, the passengers of the Ark still found it difficult to interact. This owed to the fact that language encompasses much more than mere words. It also extends to values, perceptions, expectations, histories, cultures, and special epistemic assumptions about reality that enable communication and the formation of ideas.</p>
      
        <p>For a time, these factors rendered the Ark's inhabitants unable to effectively communicate between species. An individual from a sun-circling planet would struggle to convey the symbolic significance of sunlight and warmth to a former inhabitant of a roving interstellar asteroid. Likewise, an immortal species, unaffected by cellular deterioration, would struggle to understand existential fears of death and loss. To mitigate this problem, a loose assembly of scholars formed to attempt to bridge the epistemic gaps between each species. These scholars outlined a theory of language, meaning, and communication they dubbed "the Weave" and coupled it with an altruistic mission to enable mutual understanding for every creature aboard the Ark.</p>
      
        <p>By devoting time to studying and understanding their co-inhabitants, these scholars could serve as vectors of communication — links between species. These "Weavers" quickly became crucial strains of the Ark’s complex societal web. Upon reaching Kassatím, the Weavers' roles took on an even greater importance: to conceptually bond the Ark's refugees with their new hosts. It was the Weavers who facilitated rapid cultural assimilation during the <strong>Long Century of Integration</strong>. In turn, many humans embraced the Weave’s altruistic mission, striving to bridge the gaps between the myriad pre-existing cultures, classes, castes, and perspectives of Kassatím. To this day, the Weave remains an exceedingly popular movement in urban areas. Weavers rarely function on behalf of the state or private interests but are frequently contracted to mediate between parties. Qeret has a thriving Weaver community, as it is one of the most culturally diverse cities in all of Kassatím. Currently, many Weavers in Qeret have taken up the cause of the <strong>cordepedes</strong>, who communicate with each other solely through the release of gases invisible to the human eye. As a consequence, they remain largely relegated to the fringes of Qereti society.</p>

            One might be tempted to align Ruustus with anarchistic movements such as the <strong>Unfettered</strong>, but in truth, Ruustus only asks that individuals consider whether subscribing to an ideology is truly in their self-interest. But while self-interest may rule the rein in Gallianism, it does not preclude the potential for mutual interest. Ruustus merely insists that the individual take priority over outside forces.<a href="#back-to-text1">↩</a>

            Often, Searchers will interrogate and probe Observers (see the Totality above) regarding any “significant” objects the latter have recently seen. If one seeks a Searcher, one might begin by locating an Observer.<a href="#back-to-text2">↩</a>
