        <p>Before <b>the Ark</b>’s arrival, priests and scribes expressed human philosophy, such as it was, by means of elaborate religious epistemologies. However, upon the Ark’s arrival, its inhabitants introduced exotic philosophies and worldviews that fundamentally challenged humanity’s comparably parochial understanding of the universe. Though many humans were initially hesitant to embrace such disruptive ideas, a significant number found them deeply compelling. Novel questions such as, "What does it mean to exist?" "Where does meaning originate?" and "How does one find happiness?" were concerns the Ark aliens had pondered for eons. These inquiries, and the ever-seductive possibility of discerning answers, proved irresistible to many humans. Over the past 284 years, <b>Kassatím</b> has experienced a prolonged philosophical awakening. So profound has its impact been that <b>Dryic</b> philosophers now refer to this Post-Ark era as the <i>Kosmogonia</i>, or "the birth of order." In Qeret, as in most major cities, a multitude of esoteric philosophies have taken root.</p>

        <h2>Gallianism</h2>

        <p>Gallianism is an egoist philosophical movement named for <b>Galli</b>, the Adonian god of pleasure, leisure, and delicacies. Despite the movement's name referencing a human deity, Gallians are staunch atheists and skeptics. Their belief system originated with the <i>ichor</i> <b>Ruustus</b> in the year 56 A.A. Though her species was known for its piety, Ruustus renounced these traditions in favor of a radically secular perspective. She began by denying the existence of the soul and the afterlife — a stance that certainly shocked her fellow ichor but had already gained acceptance among many. Ruustus went further, however, arguing that without a soul to maintain, or an afterlife to strive for, all living beings are free from any formal moral responsibility. As such, the only responsibility an individual has is to themselves, and to surrender oneself — our only true possession, she reasoned — to any religion, system, ideology, or dogma is akin to slavery. According to Ruustus, of these, ideology posed the greatest threat to personal fulfillment. In her words, “ideologies are like gods: specters, illusions masquerading as truth.” <sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>Ruustus attracted many followers with her assertion that each individual owes their highest allegiance to themselves. Over the past two centuries, her movement has attracted, above all, hedonists (indeed, it was they, not Ruustus, who linked the movement with Galli). They relish food, song, dance, and art above all else, and many artists in Qeret favor Gallianism for the decadence it enables. Owing to the movement's popularity, artistic depictions of Galli are second only to Nasiru in ubiquity. Once a year, the <b>Festival of Galli</b> is celebrated in the streets of Qeret, where Gallians gather to binge drink and indulge in fetes of obscene proportions.</p>

        <p>Yet, despite these egregious displays, the movement's founder remains an anomaly within it. She resides, sequestered, within the halls of the <b>Bottega</b>, but curiously, she does not share the hedonistic proclivities of her followers (though she does not begrudge them their fun). Instead, she prefers to live a life of pensive solitude and strict asceticism — a lifestyle she insists brings her the most personal satisfaction.</p>

            One might be tempted to align Ruustus with anarchistic movements such as the Unfettered, but in truth, Ruustus only asks that individuals consider whether subscribing to an ideology is truly in their self-interest. But while self-interest may rule the rein in Gallianism, it does not preclude the potential for mutual interest. Ruustus merely insists that the individual take priority over outside forces.<a href="#back-to-text1">↩</a>
