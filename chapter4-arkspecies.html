        <p>A wide variety of Ark species inhabit Qeret and the wider world of <b>Kassatím</b>. For our purposes, they have been divided into three types: Ark alien, Ark fauna, and Ark flora. The criteria for each type are as such:</p>

        <p><b>Ark Aliens</b>: Sentient and self-aware creatures capable of communication.</p>

        <p><b>Ark Fauna</b>: Sentient, though non-sapient and noncommunicative, though some exceptions to the latter two may exist.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup></p>  
        
        <p><b>Ark Flora</b>: Non-sentient plant and fungal life.</p>

        <p>This chapter is not intended to form a comprehensive list of all Ark species in Qeret — and certainly not Kassatím — but merely the most prevalent in the city, its caverns, and the <b>Bamati Plains</b>. In Appendix B, GMs may find further aliens to populate their game should the need arise.</p>

        <h3 class="centered-heading">Ark Aliens and Archetypes</h3>

        <p>Though I have attributed archetypal motivations and characteristics to each of the Ark aliens, these should be treated as general guidelines. Ark aliens can be just as idiosyncratic as any human; GMs are encouraged to distinguish their Ark alien NPCs with unique character traits, habits, and interests. In my own campaigns, I’ve introduced sensitive acumine, pacifist Marbles, and even talkative asectish. Such NPCs can pleasantly surprise players accustomed to what a species ostensibly “is,” while adding greater narrative depth.</p>
        
        <p>This kind of flexibility will not only enrich your narrative, but also forge a sense of verisimilitude, reminding players that Ark aliens — like humans — are complex and multifaceted beings.</p>

        <p>Finally, GMs should feel free to disregard any lore they feel is irrelevant or ill-suited to their group. While some players might enjoy delving into the origins of a species, others may not. Cater to your table.</p>

   <h3>Acumine</h3>
        <p>The unscrupulous acumine relish human discord and misery. Tall, skeletal, and bipedal, they possess distended foreheads and tight ginger skin that accentuates their ghoulish features. A single darting eye rests upon their forehead, betraying a cruel intelligence. Fiercely individualistic, acumine nearly always work alone, avoiding collaboration with others. They rarely conspire with other acumine and never share the spoils of their exploits. While they may have "peers" within a faction, an acumine’s motivations are their own, aligning with others only when it serves their interests.</p>

      
          <p>Considering their unsavory reputation, one might expect the Acumine to be outcasts in society. In reality, they are found in most social spheres, often occupying positions of power and influence. They might serve as minor crime lords in the underworld or advisors in royal courts, offering sage — though frequently devious — counsel to kings and queens. They secure these positions by providing what others need, whether it be advanced technology, vital information, or unsavory favors that most respectable humans or Ark aliens would never consider. The price for such "gifts" is invariably steep, and many who underestimate the Acumine's capacity for cruelty pay dearly for it. Nevertheless, by making themselves indispensable assets to their patrons, the Acumine ensure they are not only tolerated but depended upon.</p>

          <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
   <p>As an individualistic species with little to no ideological tethers, acumine can be found among most of the major factions in Qeret. Most notable is <b>Maal</b> of the <b>Ark Sodality</b> and the famous poet, <b>Zygo the Wag</b>, of the <b>Qereti Court</b>.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Acumine Origin</h4>
                <p>For millennia, the home planet of the acumine, <b>Fiamon-7</b>, was ruled by unfeeling machines whose primary technological resource was life itself. These machines designed, created, and relied on biological entities much in the way that humans build and use inanimate tools. Each biotic creation was genetically tailored to perform its designated duties flawlessly, with an inherent drive to fulfill their role, as natural to them as the human need for water.</p>

                <p>Such callous exploitation of life inevitably attracted the attention of galactic good Samaritans, sparking a cold war that engulfed Fiamon-7. Gradually, the machines began losing control of their planet to these foreign, do-gooding interlopers. In desperation, they engineered the acumine — a new form of living technology, imbued with a unique biological imperative: to take pleasure in the pain and suffering of other living creatures.</p>

                <p>The acumine were designed with two purposes in mind: first, to torture and extract information from enemy agents, and second, to intimidate and terrify interlopers. Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the acumine turned on their creators. Within a century, they had destroyed their makers by inciting internal conflict among them and dismantling the network-ecosystems their creators relied upon to survive.</p>

                <p>This apparent victory for biological life on Fiamon-7 was tragically short-lived. Without the machines to carefully regulate and sustain the planet's organic ecosystems, Fiamon-7 descended into a chaotic hellscape. Over-predation, environmental collapse, and episodes of mass suicide eventually left the world stripped of organic life. Was this the acumine's intention all along? Probably. Regardless, the Ark intervened, retrieving the few remaining species — including the acumine, in its indiscriminatory fashion — before the planet's biosphere was lost entirely.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="back-to-text2">2</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Asectish</h3>
        <p>The asectish are a bipedal, insectoid species with a bioluminescent exoskeleton composed of layers of serrated chiton. With hulking frames that stand on average 10 feet tall and 3 feet wide, the asectish — if encountered at all — can be quite intimidating. Their wide, praying mantis-like heads display two bulbous eyes resting above razor-sharp pincers. Though they navigate on two chitinous legs, the asectish have no arms but four powerful and malleable tentacles extending from their torsos. These tentacles enable them to readily grip tools, bodies, or each other, and each alone can lift four times the weight a human can.</p>

        <p>Asectish primarily reside in pastoral regions, typically laboring as farmers and shepherds. As such, they are rarely found within the confines of Qeret or any other city. Ever stoic, the asectish typically avoid contact with those outside their immediate kin system, though they generally feel a strong obligation to aid those in need. Being nocturnal creatures, they are seldom seen during the day, preferring to toil under the cover of night, their luminescent chitin emitting a soft glow that can be seen from a distance. </p>
        
        <p>The asectish shun society, rejecting all forms of hierarchy, bureaucracy, or governance, and instead cherish solitude, silence, and family above all else. However, if their kin are harmed, they will seek retribution without fail. Once roused, an asectish cannot be placated and will pursue vengeance to the end. Occasionally, some asectish deviate from the pastoralist ways of their people, instead choosing to integrate into urban society. These renegades are often drawn to positions of power, like moths to light.</p>

        <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
 <p>Though largely isolated, the asectish have inspired numerous pastoralist movements across Kassatím advocating for a return to nature and self-governance. Similarly, they are lionized by political movements like the Unfettered, who treat them as symbols of resistance and self-determination. However, most asectish reject any association with formal political organizations or ideologies, perceiving such systems as direct products of urban civilization and its moral corruptions.

    <p>As for urban asectish, though relatively rare, they can be found among some of Qeret's major factions. This includes <b>Hamil</b> of the <b>Seditionists</b>, and the master assassin, <b>Riggart</b>, of the criminal syndicate known as <b>the Puissant</b>.</p>

          <h4 class="centered-heading">Asectish Origin</h4>
              <p>Through brutal environmental conditions and a fiercely competitive evolutionary process, the asectish evolved into a cruel and tyrannical species that subjugated all other forms of life in their home system. In less than a millennium, they colonized their entire solar system, depleting the resources of planets, moons, and asteroids while exterminating and enslaving life as they advanced.</p>

              <p>Never sated, the asectish set their sights to the stars, intent on expanding their dominion across the galaxy. To achieve this, they constructed a Dyson Sphere to harvest energy from their home star, envisioning it as the key to powering their proposed interstellar drives and cataclysmic weapons of war. However, their ambition resulted in catastrophic failure when they inadvertently destabilized their star, triggering a colossal burst of cosmic rays that devastated their entire star system.</p>

              <p>What few remained of the asectish were rescued by the Ark. Plagued by a profound sense of guilt, they collectively swore to never again indulge in the sin of tyranny. During this time aboard the Ark, a visionary asectish philosopher known as Aktoshnaq — remembered now only in legend — proposed a link between the phenomenon of urbanism and a society’s use of coercion. Urban living, Aktoshnaq argued, beget resource-hoarding. This, in turn, motivated parties to subjugate others in a competitive bid to control the flow of resources.</p>

              <p>Aktoshnaq’s words were taken to heart by the asectish and have since influenced their living patterns on Kassatím. Here, the majority of asectish have denied themselves the indulgences of urban life, governance, and even of systematized ideology: a phenomenon Aktoshnaq also aligned with the abuse of power.<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="back-to-text3">3</a></sup> Since arriving, those few asectish who have returned to civilized society have rejected the beliefs of their people and embraced the tyrannical drive of their ancient ancestors.</p>
