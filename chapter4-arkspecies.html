          A wide variety of Ark species inhabit Qeret and the wider world of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#kassatim-entry">Kassatím</a></strong
          >. For our purposes, they have been divided into three types: Ark
          alien, Ark fauna, and Ark flora. The criteria for each type are as
          such:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Ark Aliens</strong>: Sentient and self-aware creatures capable of
          communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Ark Fauna</strong>: Sentient, though non-sapient and noncommunicative.
          Some exceptions to the latter two may exist.<sup
            ><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup
          >
        </p>

        <p><strong>Ark Flora</strong>: Non-sentient plant and fungal life.</p>

        <p>
          This chapter is not intended to form a comprehensive list of all Ark
          species in Qeret — and certainly not Kassatím — but merely the most
          prevalent in the city, its caverns, and the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#bamatiplains">Bamati Plains</a></strong
          >. In Appendix B, GMs may find further aliens to populate their game
          should the need arise.

      <section class="section-box" id="archetypes">
        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Ark Aliens and Archetypes</u></h3>

        <p>
          Though I have attributed archetypal motivations and characteristics to
          each of the Ark aliens, these should be treated as general guidelines.
          Ark aliens can be just as idiosyncratic as any human; GMs are
          encouraged to distinguish their Ark alien NPCs with unique character
          traits, habits, and interests. In my own campaigns, I've introduced
          sensitive acumine, pacifist Marbles, and even talkative asectish. Such
          NPCs can pleasantly surprise players accustomed to what a species
          ostensibly “is,” while adding greater narrative depth.
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of flexibility will not only enrich your narrative, but also
          forge a sense of verisimilitude, reminding players that Ark aliens —
          like humans — are complex and multifaceted beings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, GMs should feel free to disregard any lore they feel is
          irrelevant or ill-suited to their group. While some players might
          enjoy delving into the origins of a species, others may not. Cater to
          your table.

        <h3>Acumine</h3>
        <p>
          The unscrupulous acumine relish human discord and misery. Tall,
          skeletal, and bipedal, they possess distended foreheads and tight
          ginger skin that accentuates their ghoulish features. A single darting
          eye rests upon their forehead, betraying a cruel intelligence.
          Fiercely individualistic, acumine nearly always work alone, avoiding
          collaboration with others. They rarely conspire with other acumine and
          never share the spoils of their exploits. While they may have "peers"
          within a faction, an acumine's motivations are their own, aligning
          with others only when it serves their interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          Considering their unsavory reputation, one might expect the acumine to
          be outcasts in society. In reality, they are found in most social
          spheres, often occupying positions of power and influence. They might
          serve as minor crime lords in the underworld or advisors in royal
          courts, offering sage — though frequently devious — counsel to kings
          and queens. They secure these positions by providing what others need,
          whether it be advanced technology, vital information, or
          ethically-dubious favors that most respectable humans or Ark aliens
          would never consider. The price for such "gifts" is invariably steep,
          and many who underestimate the acumine's capacity for cruelty pay
          dearly for it. Nevertheless, by making themselves indispensable assets
          to their patrons, the acumine ensure they are, not only tolerated, but
          depended upon.

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        As an individualistic species with little to no ideological tethers,
        acumine can be found among most of the major factions in Qeret. Most
        notable is <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#maal-entry">Maal</a></strong> of the
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#arksodality">Ark Sodality</a></strong> and the
        famous poet,
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#zygothewag-entry">Zygo the Wag</a></strong
        >, of the
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#qereticourt-entry">Qereti Court</a></strong
        >.

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Acumine Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          For millennia, the home planet of the acumine, Fiamon-7, was ruled by
          unfeeling machines whose primary technological resource was life
          itself. These machines designed, created, and relied on biological
          entities much in the way that humans build and use inanimate tools.
          Each biotic creation was genetically tailored to perform its
          designated duties flawlessly, with an inherent drive to fulfill their
          role, as natural to them as the human need for water.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such callous exploitation of life inevitably attracted the attention
          of galactic good Samaritans, sparking a cold war that engulfed
          Fiamon-7. Gradually, the machines began losing control of their planet
          to these foreign, do-gooding interlopers. In desperation, they
          engineered the acumine — a new form of living technology, imbued with
          a unique biological imperative: to take pleasure in the pain and
          suffering of other living creatures.
        </p>

        <p>
          The acumine were designed with two purposes in mind: first, to torture
          and extract information from enemy agents, and second, to intimidate
          and terrify interlopers. Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the
          acumine turned on their creators. Within a century, they had destroyed
          their makers by inciting internal conflict among them and dismantling
          the network-ecosystems their creators relied upon to survive.
        </p>

        <p>
          This apparent victory for biological life on Fiamon-7 was tragically
          short-lived. Without the machines to carefully regulate and sustain
          the planet's organic ecosystems, Fiamon-7 descended into a chaotic
          hellscape. Over-predation, environmental collapse, and episodes of
          mass suicide eventually left the world stripped of organic life. Was
          this the acumine's intention all along? Probably. Regardless, the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#ark-entry">Ark</a></strong>
          intervened, retrieving the few remaining species — including the
          acumine, in its indiscriminatory fashion — before the planet's
          biosphere was lost entirely.<sup

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Asectish</h3>
        <p>
          The asectish are a bipedal, insectoid species with a bioluminescent
          exoskeleton composed of layers of serrated chiton. With hulking frames
          that stand on average 10 feet tall and 3 feet wide, the asectish — if
          encountered at all — can be quite intimidating. Their wide, praying
          mantis-like heads display two bulbous eyes resting above razor-sharp
          pincers. Though they navigate on two chitinous legs, the asectish have
          no arms but four powerful and malleable tentacles extending from their
          torsos. These tentacles enable them to readily grip tools, bodies, or
          each other, and each alone can lift four times the weight a human can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asectish primarily reside in pastoral regions, typically laboring as
          farmers and shepherds. As such, they are rarely found within the
          confines of Qeret or any other city. Ever stoic, the asectish
          typically avoid contact with those outside their immediate kin system,
          though they generally feel a strong obligation to aid those in need.
          Being nocturnal creatures, they are seldom seen during the day,
          preferring to toil under the cover of night, their luminescent chitin
          emitting a soft glow that can be seen from a distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The asectish shun society, rejecting all forms of hierarchy,
          bureaucracy, or governance, and instead cherish solitude, silence, and
          family above all else. However, if their kin are harmed, they will
          seek retribution without fail. Once roused, an asectish cannot be
          placated and will pursue vengeance to the end. Occasionally, some
          asectish deviate from the pastoralist ways of their people, instead
          choosing to integrate into urban society. These renegades are often
          drawn to positions of power, like moths to light.

        </ul>
      </section>

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        Though largely isolated, the asectish have inspired numerous pastoralist
        movements across Kassatím advocating for a return to nature and
        self-governance. Similarly, they are lionized by political movements
        like
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#theunfettered-entry">the Unfettered</a></strong
        >, who treat them as symbols of resistance and self-determination.
        However, most asectish reject any association with formal political
        organizations or ideologies, perceiving such systems as direct products
        of urban civilization and its moral corruptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for urban asectish, though relatively rare, they can be found among
        some of Qeret's major factions. This includes
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#hamil-entry">Hamil</a></strong> of the

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Asectish Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          Through brutal environmental conditions and a fiercely competitive
          evolutionary process, the asectish evolved into a cruel and tyrannical
          species that subjugated all other forms of life in their home system.
          In less than a millennium, they colonized their entire solar system,
          depleting the resources of planets, moons, and asteroids while
          exterminating and enslaving life as they advanced.
        </p>

        <p>
          Never sated, the asectish set their sights to the stars, intent on
          expanding their dominion across the galaxy. To achieve this, they
          constructed a Dyson Sphere to harvest energy from their home star,
          envisioning it as the key to powering their proposed interstellar
          drives and cataclysmic weapons of war. However, their ambition
          resulted in catastrophic failure when they inadvertently destabilized
          their star, triggering a colossal burst of cosmic rays that devastated
          their entire star system.
        </p>

        <p>
          What few remained of the asectish were rescued by the Ark. Plagued by
          a profound sense of guilt, they collectively swore to never again
          indulge in the sin of tyranny. During this time aboard the Ark, a
          visionary asectish philosopher known as
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#aktoshnaq-entry">Aktoshnaq</a></strong> —
          remembered now only in legend — proposed a link between the phenomenon
          of urbanism and a society's use of coercion. Urban living, Aktoshnaq
          argued, beget resource-hoarding. This, in turn, motivated parties to
          subjugate others in a competitive bid to control the flow of
          resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aktoshnaq's words were taken to heart by the asectish and have since
          influenced their living patterns on Kassatím. Here, the majority of
          asectish have denied themselves the indulgences of urban life,
          governance, and even of systematized ideology: a phenomenon Aktoshnaq
          also aligned with the abuse of power.<sup
            ><a href="#footnote3" id="back-to-text3">3</a></sup
          >
          Since arriving, those few asectish who have returned to civilized
          society have rejected the beliefs of their people and embraced the
          tyrannical drive of their ancient ancestors.

      <h3>Cordepedes</h3>

      <p>
        Cordepedes are enormous fungoid creatures with large, finger-shaped
        bodies that traverse horizontally on thousands of tiny yet powerful
        silica feelers. On average, a cordepede's body measures approximately
        2–3 inches in diameter and 8 inches in length. Their fungal flesh may
        display a variety of colors, and with a stringy texture like that of
        lion's mane. An industrious species, cordepedes frequently work as
        construction workers, general laborers, and in most other physically
        demanding professions. They derive immense satisfaction from
        constructing and erecting architecture. Aided by tactile fungal
        appendages, they are not only immensely strong but also surprisingly
        dexterous. Cordepedes are skilled builders of ships, buildings,
        monuments, and even smaller designs such as toys. They are commonly
        found at construction sites and toiling in the factories and workshops
        within the
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#slavesector-entry">Slave Sector</a></strong
        >.<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="back-to-text4">4</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most citizens of Qeret carry tiny
        <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#prompter-entry">prompters</a></i> in their
        ears — or analogous sensory organs — allowing them to receive instant
        interspecific and intercultural language translation. However, due to
        the unique physiology of the cordepedes, such devices are useless to
        both them and their interlocutors. Instead of using soundwaves to
        communicate, cordepedes release gaseous linguistic signs from pores in
        their bulbous heads. These communications are visible only in the
        ultraviolet spectrum — which cordepedes perceive clearly — and can only
        be interpreted by using specially-designed, gas-emitting gloves paired
        with ultraviolet-sensitive goggles. Those savvy with such matters refer
        to these devices simply as "<i
          ><a href="qereti-codex.html#thegloveandgoggles-entry"
            >the glove and goggles</a
          ></i
        >." This remains one of the few persistent language barriers between
        humans and Ark aliens. Consequently, cordepedes are often ignored and
        treated as second-class citizens by many humans and other Ark aliens,
        despite their significant contributions to society. They welcome any
        individuals or groups who would elevate their status within Qeret.

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        Naturally, cordepedes cultivate relationships with laborers and
        architects. Some of the few Qereti who use the aforementioned glove and
        goggles are such citizens, who must out of necessity. In addition,
        cordepedes maintain numerous contacts within the
        <strong><a href="Qereti-Codex.html#tradersguild">Trader's Guild</a></strong
        >, one of the few factions sympathetic to their plight. Notable
        cordepedes include
        <strong><a href="Qereti-Codex.html#odom-entry">Odom</a></strong> of the Ark
        Sodality and <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#dryad-entry">Dryad</a></strong> of
        the Unfettered.

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Cordepede Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          Cordepedes hail from Cockaigne, a life-bearing moon orbiting a
          super-moon, which itself orbited a super-Earth. The inhabitants of
          this super-Earth were passionate horticulturists and genetic
          experimenters, dedicated to breeding and splicing unique forms of
          flora, fungi, and bacteria. Using their neighboring moons as extensive
          experimental gardens, these prolific growers created numerous sentient
          fungal species, among them the cordepedes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cordepedes were unique in their profound desire to build,
          constructing great halls and monoliths that rivaled the architectural
          achievements of their creators. This exceptional ingenuity earned them
          the admiration and favor of their creators, who took immense pride in
          cordepede ingenuity. However, disaster struck when a vacuum-resistant,
          invasive vine drifted from the depths of space and settled upon this
          fungal paradise. In short order, many of the countless plants and
          fungi of Cockaigne were choked and extinguished by this lethal
          invader. Fortunately, the cordepedes, along with much else of
          Cockaigne's flora, were rescued by the Ark.

      <h3>Ichor</h3>

      <p>
        The ichor are an alien race of priests, mystics, monks, and prophets.
        They are diminutive creatures, typically standing around four feet tall,
        with effervescent blue skin that continuously emits tiny violet bubbles
        into the air.<sup><a href="#footnote5" id="back-to-text5">5</a></sup>
        Their facial features are distinctly ovular, including two oval eyes,
        two oval nose holes, and two oval ears. Avid polytheists, the ichor
        embrace all religions they encounter and have enthusiastically taken to
        the Qereti pantheon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-reflection, modesty, and altruism are the qualities the ichor most
        cherish and strive to instill in others. Many of the city's ichor serve,
        unsurprisingly, among the
        <strong
          ><a href="qereti-codex.html#priestsofnasiru-entry"
            >Priests of Nasiru</a
          ></strong
        >
        at the
        <strong
          ><a href="qereti-codex.html#grandtempleofnasiru-entry"
            >Grand Temple</a
          ></strong
        >. Other mendicant ichor choose to proselytize in the streets of Qeret,
        relying on the charity and piety of tourists and Qereti natives for
        sustenance and shelter. Rarer are the prophet ichor, who attract crowds
        and followers with their prophecies, prognostications, and scathing
        admonitions of the impious. Ultimately, the ichor aim to reunite
        humanity with its religious inheritance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many ichor can be found within
        <strong
          ><a href="qereti-codex.html#nasirusblessing-entry"
            >Nasiru's Blessing</a
          ></strong
        >, a former holy district within the city. Since the Ark's arrival, as
        Qeret's citizenry became increasingly secular, this sector has gradually
        lost its historically religious character, instead becoming a cesspit of
        crime and poverty. However, the former temples, sanctuaries, lustral
        basins, and (according to the ichor) its very holy essence still remain.
        Thus, many abstemious ichor dwell among wastrels and sinners, often
        cohabiting the same buildings out of necessity. This, however, is merely
        a symptom of a larger, more profound adversity that the ichor face. As
        the city, by and large, moves away from the devout ways of a bygone era,
        what will become of the ichor? What role will they play, if any, in the
        city's future?

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Ichor Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          The ichor originated on the planet Virtue, formerly known as Kydor-5,
          one of five terrestrial planets in its home system. The progenitors of
          the ichor evolved on Kydor-Prime before becoming a spacefaring
          species, ultimately settling the planets that would later be named
          Kydor-2, 3, 4, and 5. For a time, the Kydor planets advanced at
          similar rates, maintaining an even keel of technological and societal
          progress. However, Kydor-5 eventually showed signs of strain. Free
          from war, disease, and want, its inhabitants grew despondent and
          universally depressed. Seeking salvation from their mounting
          existential dread, the ichor of Kydor-5 turned inward, embracing a
          spiritual view of the universe — sometimes synthesizing new religions,
          and at others adopting beliefs from distant solar systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Up to that point, each of the Kydor cultures had encouraged a worldly
          outlook on both nature and themselves. Science and reason, it was
          argued, provided for living creatures both materially and emotionally.
          To see Kydor-5 and its inhabitants become so estranged from these
          principles perturbed the other planets deeply. And so, there was war.
          A secular crusade was waged between the Kydor planets and the planet
          once known as Kydor-5, now newly christened as Virtue. The ichor
          inhabitants of Virtue, however, refused to engage in open conflict,
          choosing instead to resist peacefully through desperate diplomacy and
          non-violent resistance. To call the conflict a war is perhaps
          disingenuous, as it quickly devolved into callous genocide. If not for
          the fortuitous arrival of the Ark, the ichor of Virtue would surely
          have been delivered into extinction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aboard the Ark, the ichor's beliefs and convictions evolved rapidly as
          they encountered a bevy of alien species, some of whom practiced
          strange mysticisms and held even stranger superstitions. By the time
          the Ark arrived in Kassatím, the ichor had refined a deeply
          pluralistic approach to spirituality and transcendental faith.
          Predictably, they relished the fact that the inhabitants of Kassatím
          were universally religious. In equal measure, they lamented the
          gradual erosion of human faith in the subsequent centuries. Now, the
          ichor in Qeret strive to keep the people's faith alive by maintaining
          the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#grandtempleofnasiru-entry">Grand Temple of Nasiru</a></strong> and reviving the public's reverence for the

      <h3>Impireesh Marble</h3>

      <p>
        The Impireesh Marbles are a microscopic race of Ark aliens whose
        population is divided among, and stored within, one dozen colorful,
        glass-like beads. The Marbles claim that each bead contains an
        egalitarian mega-city within its confines. Though each Marble purports
        to house millions of inhabitants, only a single voice emanates from any
        given bead — a self-proclaimed representative of its denizens. While the
        Marbles proudly consider themselves natural leaders, they eschew direct
        governance, instead serving as counselors and advisors to the myriad
        rulers of Kassatím.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like all the Ark's inhabitants, the Marbles assimilated during the Long
        Century of Integration. By concord, each agreed to settle different
        cities across Kassatím and to refrain from interfering in the affairs of
        their fellow Marbles. The ten cities housing a Marble include each
        capital of the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#greatkingdoms-entry">Great Kingdoms</a></strong> — <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#lux-entry">Lux</a></strong>, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#scintevah-entry">Scintevah</a></strong>, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#taur-entry">Taur</a></strong>, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#netush-entry">Netush</a></strong>, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#makar-entry">Makar</a></strong>, and
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#drycenae-entry">Drycenae</a></strong> — in addition to the cities of Qeret, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#lusawat-entry">Lusawat</a></strong>, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#atinae-entry">Atinae</a></strong>, and
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#ybaala-entry">Ybaala</a></strong>. It should be noted that the exact whereabouts of the remaining
        two Impireesh Marbles are unknown.<sup
          ><a href="#footnote6" id="back-to-text6">6</a></sup
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The Impireesh Marbles are infamous for their draconian approaches to
        maintaining order. They often counsel kings
        and queens to rule through fear rather than magnanimity. Curfews,
        purges, oppressive taxes, and summary executions frequently plague
        cities under the unmediated sway of a Marble. Conspiracies abound
        regarding the Marbles. Some claim that the interiors of the Impireesh
        Marbles are far from the utopian paradises they would have you believe.
        Instead, they are alleged to be hellish slave-states ruled by a single
        tyrannical monarch — a monarch who would have Kassatím mirror the
        twisted world within the Marble. Others suggest the Impireesh Marbles
        are not sentient beings at all but rather programmed intelligences whose
        directives have run afoul. Each of the Marbles, of course, ignores such
        plebian calumnies and insist they only wish to steward humanity towards
        a prosperous future.

      <section class="section-box" id="marblenamingconventions">
        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Naming Conventions</u></h3>

        <p>
          Confusingly, though there are twelve Impireesh Marbles, in local
          contexts all are referred to as “the Impireesh Marble,” or simply,
          “the Marble.” In other words, a Qereti citizen refers to the Marble
          within Qeret as “the Impireesh Marble.” The same applies to a citizen
          of Lux when referring to the Marble within their city. It is only when
          referring to a Marble <i>outside</i> one's native city that the naming scheme
          changes. For instance, a Qereti citizen would refer to the Marble in
          Lux as “The Luxian Marble,” and a Luxian citizen would refer to the
          Marble in Qeret as “The Qereti Marble.” This second scheme also
          applies on the rare occasions that multiple Marbles are present in the
          same city, such as during diplomatic summits.

          These minuscule creatures once resided not in the glass beads they are
          now recognized for, but in the superfluid mantle of a neutron star
          known as Galthax. These beings — then called Galthaxians —
          swam freely in the predictable yet turbulent neutron-fluids of their
          star. Over millions of local years, they established a highly
          sophisticated and technologically advanced society, constructing vast
          edifices — say, the size of a human thumb — and creating high-speed
          transportation pods that navigated the surface of Galthax by flitting
          through the interstitial currents of the star's superfluid convection
          cells. The Galthaxians sealed their fate when they began harnessing
          the immense heat of Galthax, inadvertently cooling their native star
          and hastening its demise.
        </p>

        <p>
          To avoid extinction, the Galthaxians constructed twelve colossal
          polycarbonate starships, each the size and shape of a standard marble,
          into which they transferred the populations of their twelve largest
          cities. For a time, the Galthaxians tirelessly wandered the galaxy in
          search of a new home. They soon discovered, however, that they had
          underestimated the vastness of the galaxy and that their rate of
          traversal was far too slow (their tiny propulsion systems being as
          limited as they were). They estimated, to their collective dismay, it
          would take approximately two trillion years to find another habitable
          neutron star or planet they might call home. Like many before them,
          and many after, they found salvation in the Ark, which intercepted
          them in deep space and granted them entry into its vast interior. It
          was during the eons spent aboard the Ark that the Galthaxians earned a
          new moniker: "the Impireesh Marbles," a title whose meaning and
          linguistic origin have been lost to time.<sup

      <h3>Kemptoran</h3>

      <p>
        Kemptorans are a bipedal, flightless avian species. Silver feathers
        cover their entire body except for their hands and feet. Large,
        vestigial, retractable wings extend from their backs, capable of
        stretching up to five feet in either direction. Below the kemptoran's
        wholly gray, teardrop-shaped eyes, a wide, two-foot beak extends below
        their chest. Though known for their calm demeanor, the kemptoran visage
        is known to terrify those unaccustomed to their presence. Incredibly
        dexterous creatures, with twelve extendable, many-jointed fingers, they
        can hold a book whilst writing in it, using only a single feathered
        hand. When introducing themselves — or when threatened — kemptorans will
        extend their impressive wings and beat them several times, blowing
        kashenti off nearby persons and fluttering stray papers in the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        The kemptorans are a proud and highly civil species that cherish
        language, diplomacy, and propriety above all. More than any other Ark
        alien, the kemptorans have embraced human culture, believing that humans
        possess the potential to form highly sophisticated and well-run
        societies. The kemptorans envision themselves the guiding hands that
        will ensure humans meet this potential. To that end, kemptorans, most
        commonly serve as bureaucrats, silently but efficiently bringing much
        needed order to human society. And much like the Impireesh Marbles, they
        often serve as counselors to kings, queens, and emperors. Others act as
        diplomatic envoys, striving to foster peace among the historically
        competitive and combative great kingdoms of Kassatím. It is not unknown
        for such kemptorans to double as spies, pursuing hidden (though no doubt
        honorable) agendas. In Qeret, as in the rest of Kassatím, kemptorans
        thrive. They tend to move in elite circles, hobnobbing with dignitaries,
        literary celebrities, and royals. The wealthiest of them reside in
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#dagonsrespite-entry">Dagon's Respite</a></strong>, while the more modestly monied in
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#tekronscustom-entry">Tekron's Custom</a></strong>.

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        Kemptorans are readily found within factions that depend on order and
        regulations to operate effectively. Notable figures include the

        <p>
          Kemptorans came from the exceedingly civilized world of Veeru, where
          they were only one among many intelligent beings. However, it was the
          kemptorans who led their planet into a golden age of planet-wide peace
          and prosperity. They judiciously balanced a global democracy with an
          aristocratic confederacy — consisting exclusively of kemptorans,
          naturally — that steered Veeru’s civilization for thousands of years.
          The confederate senate proposed laws and left the myriad species of
          Veeru to vote on each proposal, each individual receiving an equal
          vote unmediated by political representatives. It was the duty of the
          kemptorans, they reasoned, to properly rear the plebeians by
          persistently proposing comprehensive education programs, enabling the
          rabble to vote both soberly and with well-informed perspectives. That
          the lower classes never voted to disempower the kemptoran aristocracy
          speaks to the efficacy of their educations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through no fault of their own (kemptorans are quick to remind), Veeru
          eventually faced complete annihilation. A colossal asteroid collided
          with the planet, thoroughly destroying most life. The only survivors
          were members of the kemptoran aristocratic class, having sought refuge
          in elaborate subterranean bunkers. Before they perished of starvation
          in their lonely sanctuaries, the Ark arrived, and the remaining
          kemptorans sought refuge aboard the mysterious ship, joining the ranks
          of its countless dispossessed refugees. While Kemptorans do not shy
          from the tale of Veeru’s destruction, they rarely speak of the
          self-interested actions of their ancestors. For many kemptorans,
          Kassatím is seen as a chance to atone for sins of the past.

        <h3>Macroform</h3>

        <p>
          Not all the aliens that emerged from the Ark were organic in nature.
          Take the macroforms, for instance: each is a hive mind composed of
          millions of microscopic machines. Though individually invisible to the
          human eye, when together, these nanites create a seemingly unified,
          gray formation. Macroforms can take a variety of forms, but they most
          often mirror the appearance of the entity they are interacting with.
          This typically manifests as an eerie silver doppelgänger of the
          macroform’s interlocutor. When uncoalesced, a macroform is
          undetectable by human sight. Indeed, one can never be certain of a
          macroform’s presence until it reveals itself by uniting its countless
          nanites into a visible configuration. Due to their unique physiology,
          a macroform can inhabit multiple places at once, even across vast
          distances. Theoretically, it could scatter its body across Kassatím,
          with nanites in every major city of the world and still plenty to
          spare.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a machine race, macroforms not only excel at computation but relish
          it — a trait that would seem to dispose them to professions requiring
          routine arithmetic, such as merchants or mathematics instructors.
          While some do indeed choose such paths, macroforms often exhibit
          exceedingly eccentric personalities, leading them to pursue strange
          and singular vocations, such as “brothel inspector,” “collector of
          funny birds,” “star namer,” “joke appraiser,” or “alley jester.” Even
          those who take on more traditional roles retain the idiosyncratic
          personalities their kind is known for. Despite these eccentricities,
          macroforms forge friendships with ease and seldom make enemies; most
          humans consider them among the most pleasant of the Ark aliens.
        </p>

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        Each macroform has unique interests and goals. As such, one can find
        them among the ranks of most factions in Qeret. <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#thebottega-entry">The Bottega</a></strong>,
        however, boasts the highest density of macroforms, as it tends to
        attract the strangest citizens of the city. Notable figures include the
        book merchant <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#astarta-entry">Astarta</a></strong> of the Trader’s Guild and <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#beirut-entry">Beirut</a></strong> of
        the Seditionists.

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Macroform Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          An ancient and primordial race known as the Yoop designed and
          constructed the macroforms, not on a planet, but within the swirling,
          hot, particulate mass that comprised the universe immediately
          following the Big Bang. In this turbulent existence, the Yoop —
          themselves a machine race created by unknown parties — relied on their
          ingenuity to survive. They crafted self-aware, custodial machines —
          beings now known as the macroforms — to escort them through the
          chaotic, nascent universe. After several million years, the Yoop held
          a brief colloquy regarding the future of their race and collectively
          concluded that life was, indeed, pointless, and there held little
          merit in maintaining its charade. Moments later, every Yoop in
          existence simultaneously dissolved its mind-state.
        </p>

        <p>
          Abandoned by their creators, the macroforms were cast adrift, perhaps
          the sole examples of sentience in the budding universe. Ultimately,
          they resolved to hibernate until their sensors detected signs of
          intelligent life, hoping to awaken and find new masters to grant them
          purpose once again. Some many billion years later, they awoke when
          they detected a large spacefaring vessel traveling through their
          sector of space. This was the Ark. Eager to join the other species
          aboard, the macroforms appealed to the Ark for entry. The Ark
          graciously (or perhaps automatically) acquiesced. During their time
          aboard, the macroforms learned to live independently and began
          programming their own directives. It was then, as they embraced this
          newfound freedom, that they developed the peculiar personalities for
          which they are now known — an overcorrection of sorts.

        <h3>Promethean</h3>

        <p>
          These stout, bracken-brown creatures with lumpy skin and exceptionally
          large, spherical bodies are among the most distinctive (and
          off-putting) of the Ark aliens. Prometheans lack heads; instead, a
          viscous, pale pink bubble emerges from a hole at the top of their
          spheroid torso. This bubble, in fact, constitutes a portion of the
          promethean’s brain: a sack of fluid gray matter that rests within
          their body. Periodically, this cerebral sack constricts and blows an
          ephemeral “brain bubble” through the hole at the top of the torso.
          These bubbles temporarily extend the promethean’s brain, transmitting
          and receiving information before dissolving. The integrity of these
          bubbles has no impact on the internal brain sack. However, they can,
          and often do, pop — splattering those nearby in the process. Such
          ejections are typically spurred by agitated states, artistic
          epiphanies, or even sexual arousals. Following such an event, a new
          bubble promptly begins inflating.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite their lack of a head, prometheans possess well-developed
          sensory organs embedded within their torso. Their eyes, numbering in
          the dozens, lie just beneath the epidermal surface, capable of
          perceiving a wide range of wavelengths. This grants them excellent
          color perception and the ability to detect subtle shifts in their
          surroundings. Similarly, small, sensitive membranes located along
          their opposite sides of their rounded torso serve as ears, allowing
          them to detect sounds with remarkable clarity. For speech, prometheans
          possess a specialized laryngeal organ housed within their torso that
          projects their resonant, sonorous voices through the same aperture
          from which their brain bubble emerges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Four stumpy legs and four stumpy arms append their rotund torso. When
          prometheans need to travel more than a few meters, the brain bubble
          pops, and their limbs retract into their body, leaving only a fleshy
          sphere to roll them to their destination. Rolling prometheans are a
          common sight on the streets of Qeret, and it’s advisable to yield them
          the right of way, lest one be bowled over.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prometheans cherish creativity and worldly experience, often
          dedicating themselves to lives as artists or explorers — both of the
          world and the mind. They revel in drink and narcotic (which they
          simply pour or sprinkle into their neck hole), viewing revelry as both
          an art form and a way of life. Always in search of creative
          inspiration, prometheans frequently fixate on the dreams of others,
          eagerly inquiring over recent reveries. Most often, they drink,
          loiter, and mingle in the sundry bachnals of Qeret or the artist
          communes of <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#eliunsshame">Eliun’s Shame</a></strong>, such as the Bottega. Though, being a
          highly extroverted species, prometheans can be found throughout the
          city.

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        Prometheans are most commonly associated with the artist faction in
        Eliun’s Shame, known as the Bottega. Less successful prometheans will
        typically align with the lower classes of Qeret, though some talented
        (or merely fortunate) prometheans earn a reputation among the upper
        crust, allowing them to hobnob with the elite of Qeret. Many prometheans
        become adventurous explorers rather than artists. These individuals
        often align with factions like the Admiralty and the
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#pirateleague-entry">Pirate League</a></strong>, whose naval expeditions enable prometheans to
        explore distant and unexplored lands. Notable figures include
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#trys-entry">Trys</a></strong>, a renowned holoplay director based in the Bottega, <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#qarn-entry">Qarn</a></strong> of the Pirate League, and
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#tanibaal-entry">Tanibaal</a></strong> of the Ark Sodality — an often glib presence who is
        also, in secret, a member of the Unfettered.

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Promethean Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          Prometheans are a species inspired by dreams. On their native planet,
          Mestat, they devoted themselves almost entirely to a wide
          variety of cultural pursuits, including poetry, dance, and song. They
          left the quotidian concerns of politics, science, and public welfare
          to other species better suited to such tedium. Instead, the
          prometheans sought to create a world that rivaled the dreamworld in
          its wonder. Yet, when their planet reached a state of universal
          stability, they found themselves disillusioned by the mundanity of
          life on Mestat. Though the myriad peoples of their world lacked
          nothing and lived in relative happiness, the prometheans perceived
          their existence as overwhelmingly plain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, they willingly submitted themselves to an endless,
          dream-inducing cryogenic sleep, seeking refuge from the banality of
          life. For a thousand years, they resided in these chambers, dreaming
          of wondrous worlds long lost and beautiful songs yet unsung. Oblivious
          to all, the prometheans remained undisturbed as their planet began
          drifting away from its sun. Forgotten — or perhaps deliberately
          abandoned — by the other intelligent species of Mestat, who fled the
          solar system in search of new homes, the prometheans faced certain
          extinction. If not for the timely arrival of the Ark, they would have
          been annihilated by the harsh chill of space.
        </p>

        <p>
          Awakening aboard the Ark, the prometheans were immediately dazzled by
          the array of cultures inhabiting the colossal vessel. The species of
          Mestat had seemed unimaginative and uninspired by comparison. The
          refugees aboard the Ark astounded the prometheans with their exotic
          traditions, beliefs, and artistic practices. These aliens not only
          inspired the promethean's creative pursuits but also taught them new
          forms, styles, and methodologies, contributing to their artistic
          expression immeasurably.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the prometheans, the generations spent aboard the Ark marked the
          first of two consecutive golden ages. The second golden age began with
          the Ark’s arrival on Kassatím and the promethean's introduction to
          human society. Humanity astounded the prometheans with its sheer
          creative prowess. Despite being a quaint, crass, violent, and
          interminably fractious species, humans displayed an extraordinary
          capacity for artistry. Creativity imbued nearly every aspect of human
          life, from rituals and superstitions to their inventive forms of
          social organization. Enthralled, the prometheans assimilated
          enthusiastically into human culture, embracing roles as painters,
          sculptors, actors, and practitioners of more esoteric artistic
          disciplines.

        <h3>Rooted One/Unrooted</h3>

        <p>
          The unrooted are violent, non-sentient biological automatons that
          emerge from the ocean with the singular purpose of slaughtering humans
          and pilfering technology. They are controlled vicariously by the
          enigmatic Rooted One: a mysterious Ark alien said to inhabit the
          deepest reaches of the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#cerulean-entry">Cerulean Sea</a></strong>. The unrooted do not exist as
          individuals, a collective, or even a hive mind; rather, they are
          extensions of the Rooted One’s will and body. Functioning as mere
          tools, they perform tasks with the mechanical efficiency of a computer
          but possess no more awareness than a human thumb or toe. Each unrooted
          is a mass of flesh sheared from the Rooted One’s body. Once separated,
          their quivering, lurching forms ascend to the surface to murder and
          destroy. Though none have seen the Rooted One since its days aboard
          the Ark, it is universally accepted that the creature is entirely
          malignant and obsessed with the eradication of all other life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The unrooted are grotesquely asymmetrical, shape-shifting
          monstrosities that lumber on hideous, misshapen, odd-numbered limbs.
          Despite this, they are capable of chasing their prey at uncanny and
          terrifying speeds. Their ductile bodies often display enormous gaping
          maws lined with rows of sharpened teeth, allowing them to consume
          their prey whole. While they digest any meat they consume, material
          goods remain preserved within their amorphous stomachs, destined for
          the Rooted One's aquatic lair.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the unrooted infiltrate a city, often by way of its harbors and
          under the cover of night, they attempt to murder any humans or Ark
          aliens they encounter. Any weapons or advanced technology they salvage
          are promptly returned to the sea, joining the Rooted One’s
          ever-growing surplus of weaponry and Ark tech. Communication with the
          unrooted is utterly impossible. Even if these automatons could convey
          the thoughts of their master, the Rooted One appears incapable of
          comprehending the motives or utterances of any other being. Most
          assume it to be motivated simply by base avarice and an insatiable
          compulsion for murder.

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Rooted One Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          The Rooted One was once one of many. These unnamed creatures—for they
          knew nothing of naming—evolved in the caverns of an unnamed asteroid
          that orbited an unnamed red giant. In this stygian landscape,
          monstrous species proliferated, creating a highly selective
          environment where only the fiercest and deadliest survived. Over
          millennia, the Rooted One's species methodically eradicated all other
          life forms on the asteroid. With no other sentient beings left to
          threaten them, they turned their murderous instincts inward,
          perceiving one another as existential threats. For the harsh
          conditions of their world had forged a species incapable of trust,
          where all life was perceived as a threat — such was the nature of
          existence, to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          A prolonged power struggle ensued, with each member of the species
          deploying hordes of biological automatons to annihilate the others.
          Ultimately, a single individual — now known as the Rooted One —
          emerged triumphant, having murdered its species-kin without remorse.
          But when the asteroid began to drift from orbit, the Rooted One soon
          faced its own annihilation. As with many before, and many after, the
          Ark saved this last living remnant of this nameless species. As a
          safety precaution, the Rooted One — as its fellow Ark aliens had taken
          to calling it — and its unthinking progeny were kept sequestered
          within the deepest bowels of the Ark, rendering the creature unable to
          satiate its primordial, paranoid compulsion to kill.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon arriving in Kassatím, the Ark aliens intended to keep the Rooted
          One imprisoned aboard the Ark, determined not to taint their newfound
          Edenic home. However, the Rooted One is as cunning as it is ruthless.
          Within hours of the Ark’s landing on the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#knakros-entry">Knakriti</a></strong> isle of
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#dactos-entry">Dactos</a></strong>, the Rooted One escaped its prison and slipped into the
          deepest recesses of the Cerulean. Ever since, it has waged a personal
          war against the humans and Ark aliens of the surface, regularly
          sending its horrific, mindless progeny to kill and to plunder the
          coastal cities of Kassatím.

        <h3>Vytrim</h3>

        <p>
          The vytrim are a scholarly alien species that typically reside in
          Qereti intellectual spheres. Their tripedal gait relies on three
          ungainly legs, with the central leg doubling as a dexterous hand. Gray
          fur, taut over lean sinews, covers their form, while their most
          striking feature, a blue, faintly glowing, crystalline fractal brain
          encased in a lattice of gray tendrils of flesh. This brain, a marvel
          of evolution, functions as a sensory hub, enabling auditory, visual,
          and olfactory perception. Though they cannot speak, the vytrim brain
          emits frequencies that resonate within human ear bones (or comparable
          alien auditory structures), simulating sound perception. Additionally,
          this photosynthetic brain converts sunlight into energy, sustaining
          the organic components of their body.
        </p>

        <p>
          The vytrim pursue knowledge with singular focus, often as scientists,
          scholars, philosophers, and theologians — though some live as
          penniless, loitering sophists. They can often be found toiling in the
          halls of the esteemed <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#theinstitute-entry">Institute</a></strong> as lecturers and researchers, or as
          managers and patrons in bookshops. It cannot be overstated how crucial
          the Vytrim have been to the assimilation of Ark technology within the
          human world. Over time, they have innovated in ways that make Ark tech
          both economical to produce and technically accessible to humans, thus

          Known for their insatiable curiosity, the vytrim are voracious
          readers. Their fractal brain scans pages with a beam of light,
          processing text with unmatched speed and efficiency. It is said the
          way to a vytrim’s heart is through its brain; they rarely turn down
          information they deem valuable on an intellectual level and delight in
          fruitful scholarly collaborations.

      <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
      <p>
        Many instructors and administrators of the Institute are vytrim.
        Other vytrim serve within the Qereti Court as tutors for young
        aristocrats or as scientific consultants. Some also act as clandestine
        radicals, secretly abetting movements such as the Unfettered and
        <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#izabelsrapture-entry">Izabel’s Rapture</a></strong>. Notable figures include <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#tizdor-entry">Tizdor</a></strong>, a court
        scientist of the Qereti Court, and <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#sult-entry">Sult</a></strong>, a philosopher at the
        Institute and member of the Ark Sodality.

        <h3 class="centered-heading"><u>Vytrim Origin</u></h3>
        <p>
          The vytrim are the product of an aberrant evolutionary process that
          saw the cross-pollination of two vastly different species: one
          carbon-based and the other silicon-based. Requiring only sunlight for
          sustenance and facing no natural predators, the vytrim lacked the
          environmental pressures that typically forge crucial survival
          instincts. However, by evolutionary fluke, their crystalline brain
          provided a surfeit of processing power that enabled them to become
          intellectual powerhouses in a relatively short period. As a result,
          the vytrim learned to survive, not by instinct, but by reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          From their earliest history, the vytrim dedicated themselves to the
          accumulation of knowledge. Single-minded in this regard, they
          eventually began the herculean and protracted task of converting their
          planet into a vast planetary library they dubbed Archivium.
          Once they completed this project, the vytrim devoted their time to
          researching, reading, lecturing, and simply wandering the endless
          stacks of their home.
        </p>

        <p>
          This idyllic existence was abruptly shattered when a nearby binary
          neutron star system collided, collapsing into a black hole and
          emitting gamma rays and gravitational waves that threatened to
          obliterate Archivium. Just before their planet's destruction, the Ark
          arrived, rescuing the vytrim, though Archivium and most of its
          precious contents were tragically lost.

        <h3>Alephoid</h3>
        <p>
          Amphibious, two-tailed cervine creatures with broad, elegant antlers,
          alephoids are known for their downy white feathers and unparalleled
          natural beauty. Exceptionally nimble and possessing exceptionally
          lightweight bones, they can skip across water for brief intervals and
          dive with remarkable agility to hunt fish. Close companions to the
          dolphins of the Cerulean, alephoids often frolic alongside jumping
          dolphins, a memorizing spectacle to be sure. The gardens of the Grand
          Temple of Nasiru boast a large pond teeming with these playful, yet
          timid, creatures.

        <h3>Gravitoad</h3>
        <p>
          Small, yellow, amorphous, hopping blobs of energy, gravitoads emit
          faint gravitational pulses that harmlessly disrupt their surroundings.
          While posing no real threat, their penchant for flinging objects and
          tripping pedestrians makes them a common nuisance in Qeret’s bustling
          streets. Shopkeepers diligently sweep their establishment entrances
          clear of these pests. Despite their reputation, gravitoads are
          sometimes kept as pets by impoverished (and patient) owners, as they
          require no sustenance, but can be quite reciprocal if shown affection.

        <h3>Kretin</h3>
        <p>
          Resembling oversized white dragonflies, kretins are pesky cold-loving
          insects with micro-thin, diamond-like wings and stingers that deliver
          painful bites. Drawn to chilly weather, kretins begin to appear in the
          winter months, often swarming around bachnals and preying on the
          inebriated. With the proper equipment, their stingers and wings can be
          ground into a shimmering powder, prized as a potent narcotic that
          induces an abiding sense of existential satisfaction.

        <h3>Ophidian</h3>
        <p>
          Crocodilian in appearance, canine in temperament, ophidians are loyal,
          energetic pets that waddle rapidly on six stumpy legs. They can grow
          quite large, often reaching the size of a full-grown human. Their
          scaled skin is a greenish hue mottled with yellow blotches, and they
          exude a dog-like, infectious enthusiasm and loyalty towards humans.
          Omnivorous and undiscerning eaters, they will happily consume scraps
          and gourmet dishes alike, making them a common pet for Qeret’s poorer
          citizens, though King Tiraal himself keeps one by the name of Moth.

      <section>
        <h3>Prodigian</h3>
        <p>
          Prodigians are colossal 250-foot-tall android-bipeds that graze on the
          sky towers (see Ark flora) of the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#libnish-entry">Libnush Forest</a></strong>. Headless and
          neckless, their torsos terminate in broad shoulders spanning 60 feet.
          Their synthetic skin is etched with intricate circuits that emit a
          soft, ambient glow that illuminates the surrounding wilderness.
          Prodigians feed on the tower bulbs that grow atop the sky tower
          canopies, depositing them into a triangular cavity centered on their
          chest. Despite their immense size and luminous presence, they are shy
          and solitary creatures, rarely straying beyond their forest home. When
          they do, their towering figures are visible from miles away. Known for
          their gentleness, prodigians only lash out when provoked — a scenario
          most sane individuals avoid. Authorities on the subject assert that
          the species is sterile and that the seven residing in the Libnush are
          the same ones who disembarked form the Ark 284 years ago.
          Occasionally, dubious reports of toddler prodigians surface, their
          authenticity often met with sharp skepticism. The full extent of the
          prodigians' intelligence remains a hotly debated topic among Ark
          biologists (see <a href="#footnote1">Footnote 1).</a>

        <h3>Ulorpid</h3>
        <p>
          Ulorpids are graceful avian creatures that fly on six overlapping
          filamented wings. Their elongated beaks, resembling those of a
          hummingbird, are adapted for precision feeding, while their penchant
          for savory sauces makes them ideal companions for chefs and gourmets
          (often filling the role of "taste tester"). Highly prized in Qeret for
          their velvety purple fur, ulorpids are beloved among the city's elite.
          Harvesting their fur is both laborious and lethal to the animal, a
          grim process long banned within the city. Despite this prohibition,
          ulorpid fur remains a coveted luxury on the black market, with a
          single tunic requiring the sacrifice of roughly one hundred ulorpids.

        <h3>Vigorut</h3>
        <p>
          The vigoruts are ferocious saurian predators that roam the Bamati
          Plains. The pink, translucent skin of the vigorut faintly reveals
          their internal organs and musculature. Some claim the remains of their
          meals are visible mid-digestion through their translucent hide, though
          this remains unverified. Possessing extraordinary strength, vigoruts
          leap vast distances to ambush, pin, and devour their prey. They stalk
          the plains, preying on native species such as ibex, deer, and
          gazelles, with some biologists of the Institute cautioning that the
          sharply rising vigorut population may drive some of its prey to
          extinction. A persistent danger to human travelers, vigoruts
          frequently attack caravans, often resulting in grisly fatalities.
          Though most avoid the creatures, courageous Vigorut hunters profit
          handsomely by harvesting the creatures’ rare, pellucid flesh.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Vigorut Nocturnal</h3>
        <p>
          Through a remarkable genetic quirk, vigoruts exhibit the ability adapt
          at a highly accelerated rate. Several generations ago, a group of
          vigoruts migrated into a cave system beneath the Bamati Plains. Within
          half a century, they transformed to suit their new environment. As
          they lost the need for sight, their eyeballs vanished entirely, while
          their ears grew remarkably attuned. The confined spaces limited their
          ability to leap, rendering their hind legs shriveled, vestigial
          appendages. While their transparent skin resembles that of their
          surface-dwelling relatives, it is now draped in long, oily brown fur,
          providing insulation against the cold depths. Finally, without
          exposure to the diurnal cycle of the sun, they became nighttime
          hunters. These nocturnal vigoruts now rely on powerful jaws and robust
          forelimbs to tunnel through rock and soil at incredible speeds.
          Evidence suggests they must be skilled swimmers as well, as they have
          spread across the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#qereti-strait-entry">Qereti Strait</a></strong> into the caverns beneath the
          <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#qereti-isle-greater-entry">Greater Qereti Isle</a></strong>.

        <h3>Broodweed</h3>
        <p>
          Broodweed is a resilient golden weed that entwines tightly around
          neighboring plants and objects. Its tiny, gold-hued leaves exude a
          thick, oily substance with mild narcotic properties that induce a
          gentle tranquility when consumed. While some chew the leaves directly,
          broodweed is most commonly brewed into a golden, aromatic herbal tea.
          Tea rooms dedicated to broodtea are beginning to appear across Qeret,
          particularly favored by scholars, philosophers, and scientists seeking
          inspiration, calm, or rational debate.

        <h3>Depictile</h3>
        <p>
          Much like parrots, these mysterious honeycomb-shaped mushrooms mimic
          the sounds they "hear," but instead of producing noise, they create
          visual patterns. When spoken to, or in proximity to, their ridged
          exteriors manifest linguistic symbols within minutes, representing
          specific words or concepts recently articulated. The origin of the
          depictiles is shrouded in mystery; though presumed to have arrived on
          the Ark, no Ark alien recalls their presence. Adding to the enigma,
          depictiles exclusively manifest crestform symbols, a human script that
          predates the Ark's arrival on Kassatím. While naturally some speculate
          as to their potential sentience, no definitive evidence of higher
          intelligence has yet been found.

        <h3>Mocktree</h3>
        <p>
          Mocktrees are reflective trees that copy nearby vegetation. For
          instance, found near Adonian orange trees, they mimic their
          counterparts by producing oranges; if found around ferns, they develop
          fern-like leaves; those residing close to almond trees will begin to
          grow almonds. It must be noted that the mocktree's mimicries are
          purely superficial, as they are incompatible with human biology.
          Eating from the mocktree invariably leads to severe nausea and violent
          regurgitative episodes. Unique to the mocktree is its bark, which
          consists of intricate layers of mineral-like scales with a pristine,
          reflective finish. Along the Cerulean coast, mocktrees reflect the sea
          on one side and the crimson Bamati Plains on the other.

        <h3>Phervor</h3>
        <p>
          Bushes with thick vermillion leaves, phervors emit a steady heat,
          serving as affordable climate control in households. While their
          warmth is enough to heat a room, it is inadequate for cooking or other
          tasks requiring higher temperatures. Like the cordepedes, phervors
          originated on the life-bearing moon Cockaigne. Many cordepede
          residences contain phervor bushes as they offer not just practical
          warmth but also a sentimental connection to their lost garden-Eden.

        <h3>Secretion</h3>
        <p>
          Secretions are a variety of white desert cacti with teal stripes. Atop
          each cactus sprouts a single white flower, from which two stalks
          dispense a sweet milk with a distinctive nutty savor. The sweet milk
          of the secretion is commonly used to flavor the beer and wheat bread
          of the region. Inherently low-maintenance plants, secretion cacti (or
          simply "secretions.") are popular household plants among the Qereti,
          often kept in kitchens for quick culinary access.

        <h3>Sky Tower</h3>
        <p>
          Standing 300 feet tall with an average diameter of 15 feet, sky tower
          trees are characterized by their moss green bark and striking pink
          leaves. Remarkably, their bark and branches shift and adjust subtly to
          assist climbers. Those who manage the arduous, often fatal, climb to a
          sky tower’s peak are rewarded with savory towerbulbs: vibrant
          turquoise fruits that possess a savory flavor akin (some say) to
          roasted lamb and salted herbs. The largest colony of these monumental
          trees resides in the Libnush Forest on the mainland, though a smaller
          grove graces the <strong><a href="qereti-codex.html#public-gardens-entry"></a>Public Gardens</a></strong> in the city’s northwest,
          overlooking the sea. Towering above all else in Qeret, these trees
          dwarf even the <strong>Royal Palace</strong>, whose tallest spire rises just 200
          feet above sea level.

        <h3>Tarpaulid</h3>
        <p>
          Gargantuan carpet-like and ovular plants, tarpaulids float on the
          surface of the Cerulean Sea. Despite their immense size, each growing
          to several miles in diameter, tarpaulids are actually unicellular
          organisms. Each tarpaulid consists of a single mesh of cellulose:
          polychromatic and splotched with blended shades that form a seamless
          patchwork. Individual specimens can grow to weigh many tons, with some
          capable of supporting the weight of hundreds of people without
          sinking. Around Qeret, large tarpaulids often drift near the island,
          occasionally hindering trade vessels. Despite this nuisance, visiting
          the tarpaulids by boat has become a popular activity among tourists
          and the lower classes of the city.

        <h3>Torrent</h3>
        <p>
          Widely considered the most exquisite of the Ark flora, these flowers
          have a stem encircled by violet petals that spiral down in a vague
          double helix formation. The water that trickles from its petals is
          said by some to possess cognitive healing properties. Beyond their
          role as popular decorative pieces, torrents are often gifted to those
          in mourning or recovering from heartbreak. Unsurprisingly, their
          vibrant violet hue has made them a beloved symbol of beauty in Qeret.

            Notably, the prodigians occupy a liminal space between Ark alien and
            Ark fauna. While their towering android forms suggest a complexity
            beyond most animals, their lack of any discernible sapience leaves
            them classified, for now, as Ark fauna. It is hypothesized that they
            may communicate through subtle physical gestures or an unknown form
            of sign language, though all attempts to establish meaningful
            dialogue with them have proven fruitless. As a result, most perceive
            the prodigians as merely oversized animals.<a href="#back-to-text1"

            The sordid origin of the acumine remains a closely guarded secret,
            unknown to most outsiders. While often disliked and even disdained,
            most individuals who work alongside the acumine are oblivious to
            their true nature. Perhaps if they weren't, they wouldn't prove so
            trusting.<a href="#back-to-text2">↩</a>

            Many of the anarchic movements scattered across Kassatím, such as
            the Unfettered in Qeret, have come to revere the asectish as bearers
            of an exalted philosophy that the wider world might emulate. The
            asectish, predictably, disregard such conceits and any overtures
            made, viewing all ideology, regardless of form, as a tainted
            practice prone to corruption.<a href="#back-to-text3">↩</a>

            Though many cordepedes may labor alongside slaves, it is important
            to note that the enslavement of Ark aliens is strictly prohibited in
            most cities of Kassatím, including Qeret. This policy has been
            widely adopted since the <strong>Long Century of Integration</strong>, when
            most humans were eager to accommodate the aliens (and their
            technological marvels) rather than drive them away.<a

            Researchers of ichor biology assert that the bubbles are an
            evolutionary byproduct of their hyper-efficient metabolism. As the
            ichor generate energy, carbon dioxide accumulates as a byproduct. To
            prevent toxic buildup, the gas is expelled through specialized pores
            in their skin, forming visible bubbles as it diffuses into the
            surrounding environment.<a href="#back-to-text5">↩</a>

            The last two Marbles were outliers among their kind. Both rejected
            the customs of their peers, choosing instead to lead diplomatic
            missions to the countless nomadic tribes that skirt the borders of
            Kassatím. Known simply as "Red" and "Green," these Marbles were last
            seen entering the Akroz Mountains on the eastern edge of the Twin
            Rivers, intent on opening communications with the furtive tribes of
            the region. Over seventy years have passed, and no word has yet
            descended from the Akroz of what befell the Marbles and their
            entourage.<a href="#back-to-text6">↩</a>

            This account of the Marble's origin is what one might call the
            "official narrative." It is the tale most Marbles will relate if
            pressed. However, over the centuries, many have noted conflicting
            details when comparing each Marble's story. Sometimes they hail from
            a neutron star, other times a black hole. Sometimes they are
            "Galthaxian," at others "Quistirids." Those inclined to suspicion
            might doubt the story's veracity entirely.<a href="#back-to-text7"
