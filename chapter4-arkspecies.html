        <p>A wide variety of Ark species inhabit Qeret and the wider world of <b>Kassatím</b>. For our purposes, they have been divided into three types: Ark alien, Ark fauna, and Ark flora. The criteria for each type are as such:</p>

        <p><b>Ark Aliens</b>: Sentient and self-aware creatures capable of communication.</p>

        <p><b>Ark Fauna</b>: Sentient, though non-sapient and noncommunicative, though some exceptions to the latter two may exist.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text">1</a></sup></p>  
        
        <p><b>Ark Flora</b>: Non-sentient plant and fungal life.</p>

        <p>This chapter is not intended to form a comprehensive list of all Ark species in Qeret — and certainly not Kassatím — but merely the most prevalent in the city, its caverns, and the <b>Bamati Plains</b>. In Appendix B, GMs may find further aliens to populate their game should the need arise.</p>

        <h3 class="centered-heading">Ark Aliens and Archetypes</h3>

        <p>Though I have attributed archetypal motivations and characteristics to each of the Ark aliens, these should be treated as general guidelines. Ark aliens can be just as idiosyncratic as any human; GMs are encouraged to distinguish their Ark alien NPCs with unique character traits, habits, and interests. In my own campaigns, I’ve introduced sensitive Acumine, pacifist Marbles, and even talkative Asectish. Such NPCs can pleasantly surprise players accustomed to what a species ostensibly “is,” while adding greater narrative depth.</p>
        
        <p>This kind of flexibility will not only enrich your narrative, but also forge a sense of verisimilitude, reminding players that Ark aliens — like humans — are complex and multifaceted beings.</p>

        <p>Finally, GMs should feel free to disregard any lore they feel is irrelevant or ill-suited to their group. While some players might enjoy delving into the origins of a species, others may not. Cater to your table.</p>

   <h3>Acumine</h3>
        <p>The unscrupulous acumine relish human discord and misery. Tall, skeletal, and bipedal, they possess distended foreheads and tight ginger skin that accentuates their ghoulish features. A single darting eye rests upon their forehead, betraying a cruel intelligence. Fiercely individualistic, acumine nearly always work alone, avoiding collaboration with others. They rarely conspire with other acumine and never share the spoils of their exploits. While they may have "peers" within a faction, an acumine’s motivations are their own, aligning with others only when it serves their interests.</p>

      
          <p>Considering their unsavory reputation, one might expect the Acumine to be outcasts in society. In reality, they are found in most social spheres, often occupying positions of power and influence. They might serve as minor crime lords in the underworld or advisors in royal courts, offering sage — though frequently devious — counsel to kings and queens. They secure these positions by providing what others need, whether it be advanced technology, vital information, or unsavory favors that most respectable humans or Ark aliens would never consider. The price for such "gifts" is invariably steep, and many who underestimate the Acumine's capacity for cruelty pay dearly for it. Nevertheless, by making themselves indispensable assets to their patrons, the Acumine ensure they are not only tolerated but depended upon.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Acumine Origin</h4>
                <p>For millennia, the home planet of the acumine, Fiamon-7, was ruled by unfeeling machines whose primary technological resource was life itself. These machines designed, created, and relied on biological entities much in the way that humans build and use inanimate tools. Each biotic creation was genetically tailored to perform its designated duties flawlessly, with an inherent drive to fulfill their role, as natural to them as the human need for water.</p>

                <p>Such callous exploitation of life inevitably attracted the attention of galactic good Samaritans, sparking a cold war that engulfed Fiamon-7. Gradually, the machines began losing control of their planet to these foreign, do-gooding interlopers. In desperation, they engineered the acumine — a new form of living technology, imbued with a unique biological imperative: to take pleasure in the pain and suffering of other living creatures.</p>

                Notably, the prodigians occupy a liminal space between Ark alien and Ark fauna. While their towering android forms suggest a complexity beyond most animals, their lack of any discernible sapience leaves them classified, for now, as Ark Fauna. It is hypothesized that they may communicate through subtle physical gestures or an unknown form of sign language, though all attempts to establish meaningful dialogue with them have proven fruitless. As a result, most perceive the prodigians as merely oversized animals.<a href="#back-to-text">↩</a>
