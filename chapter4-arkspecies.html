        <p>A wide variety of Ark species inhabit Qeret and the wider world of <b>Kassatím</b>. For our purposes, they have been divided into three types: Ark alien, Ark fauna, and Ark flora. The criteria for each type are as such:</p>

        <p><b>Ark Aliens</b>: Sentient and self-aware creatures capable of communication.</p>

        <p><b>Ark Fauna</b>: Sentient, though non-sapient and noncommunicative. Some exceptions to the latter two may exist.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup></p>  
        
        <p><b>Ark Flora</b>: Non-sentient plant and fungal life.</p>

        <p>This chapter is not intended to form a comprehensive list of all Ark species in Qeret — and certainly not Kassatím — but merely the most prevalent in the city, its caverns, and the <b>Bamati Plains</b>. In Appendix B, GMs may find further aliens to populate their game should the need arise.</p>

        <h3 class="centered-heading">Ark Aliens and Archetypes</h3>

        <p>Though I have attributed archetypal motivations and characteristics to each of the Ark aliens, these should be treated as general guidelines. Ark aliens can be just as idiosyncratic as any human; GMs are encouraged to distinguish their Ark alien NPCs with unique character traits, habits, and interests. In my own campaigns, I've introduced sensitive acumine, pacifist Marbles, and even talkative asectish. Such NPCs can pleasantly surprise players accustomed to what a species ostensibly “is,” while adding greater narrative depth.</p>
        
        <p>This kind of flexibility will not only enrich your narrative, but also forge a sense of verisimilitude, reminding players that Ark aliens — like humans — are complex and multifaceted beings.</p>

        <p>Finally, GMs should feel free to disregard any lore they feel is irrelevant or ill-suited to their group. While some players might enjoy delving into the origins of a species, others may not. Cater to your table.</p>

   <h3>Acumine</h3>
        <p>The unscrupulous acumine relish human discord and misery. Tall, skeletal, and bipedal, they possess distended foreheads and tight ginger skin that accentuates their ghoulish features. A single darting eye rests upon their forehead, betraying a cruel intelligence. Fiercely individualistic, acumine nearly always work alone, avoiding collaboration with others. They rarely conspire with other acumine and never share the spoils of their exploits. While they may have "peers" within a faction, an acumine's motivations are their own, aligning with others only when it serves their interests.</p>

      
          <p>Considering their unsavory reputation, one might expect the Acumine to be outcasts in society. In reality, they are found in most social spheres, often occupying positions of power and influence. They might serve as minor crime lords in the underworld or advisors in royal courts, offering sage — though frequently devious — counsel to kings and queens. They secure these positions by providing what others need, whether it be advanced technology, vital information, or unsavory favors that most respectable humans or Ark aliens would never consider. The price for such "gifts" is invariably steep, and many who underestimate the Acumine's capacity for cruelty pay dearly for it. Nevertheless, by making themselves indispensable assets to their patrons, the Acumine ensure they are not only tolerated but depended upon.</p>

          <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
   <p>As an individualistic species with little to no ideological tethers, acumine can be found among most of the major factions in Qeret. Most notable is <b>Maal</b> of the <b>Ark Sodality</b> and the famous poet, <b>Zygo the Wag</b>, of the <b>Qereti Court</b>.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Acumine Origin</h4>
                <p>For millennia, the home planet of the acumine, <b>Fiamon-7</b>, was ruled by unfeeling machines whose primary technological resource was life itself. These machines designed, created, and relied on biological entities much in the way that humans build and use inanimate tools. Each biotic creation was genetically tailored to perform its designated duties flawlessly, with an inherent drive to fulfill their role, as natural to them as the human need for water.</p>

                <p>Such callous exploitation of life inevitably attracted the attention of galactic good Samaritans, sparking a cold war that engulfed Fiamon-7. Gradually, the machines began losing control of their planet to these foreign, do-gooding interlopers. In desperation, they engineered the acumine — a new form of living technology, imbued with a unique biological imperative: to take pleasure in the pain and suffering of other living creatures.</p>

                <p>The acumine were designed with two purposes in mind: first, to torture and extract information from enemy agents, and second, to intimidate and terrify interlopers. Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the acumine turned on their creators. Within a century, they had destroyed their makers by inciting internal conflict among them and dismantling the network-ecosystems their creators relied upon to survive.</p>

                <p>This apparent victory for biological life on Fiamon-7 was tragically short-lived. Without the machines to carefully regulate and sustain the planet's organic ecosystems, Fiamon-7 descended into a chaotic hellscape. Over-predation, environmental collapse, and episodes of mass suicide eventually left the world stripped of organic life. Was this the acumine's intention all along? Probably. Regardless, the Ark intervened, retrieving the few remaining species — including the acumine, in its indiscriminatory fashion — before the planet's biosphere was lost entirely.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="back-to-text2">2</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Asectish</h3>
        <p>The asectish are a bipedal, insectoid species with a bioluminescent exoskeleton composed of layers of serrated chiton. With hulking frames that stand on average 10 feet tall and 3 feet wide, the asectish — if encountered at all — can be quite intimidating. Their wide, praying mantis-like heads display two bulbous eyes resting above razor-sharp pincers. Though they navigate on two chitinous legs, the asectish have no arms but four powerful and malleable tentacles extending from their torsos. These tentacles enable them to readily grip tools, bodies, or each other, and each alone can lift four times the weight a human can.</p>

        <p>Asectish primarily reside in pastoral regions, typically laboring as farmers and shepherds. As such, they are rarely found within the confines of Qeret or any other city. Ever stoic, the asectish typically avoid contact with those outside their immediate kin system, though they generally feel a strong obligation to aid those in need. Being nocturnal creatures, they are seldom seen during the day, preferring to toil under the cover of night, their luminescent chitin emitting a soft glow that can be seen from a distance. </p>
        
        <p>The asectish shun society, rejecting all forms of hierarchy, bureaucracy, or governance, and instead cherish solitude, silence, and family above all else. However, if their kin are harmed, they will seek retribution without fail. Once roused, an asectish cannot be placated and will pursue vengeance to the end. Occasionally, some asectish deviate from the pastoralist ways of their people, instead choosing to integrate into urban society. These renegades are often drawn to positions of power, like moths to light.</p>

        <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
    <p>Though largely isolated, the asectish have inspired numerous pastoralist movements across Kassatím advocating for a return to nature and self-governance. Similarly, they are lionized by political movements like <b>the Unfettered</b>, who treat them as symbols of resistance and self-determination. However, most asectish reject any association with formal political organizations or ideologies, perceiving such systems as direct products of urban civilization and its moral corruptions.

    <p>As for urban asectish, though relatively rare, they can be found among some of Qeret's major factions. This includes <b>Hamil</b> of the <b>Seditionists</b>, and the master assassin, <b>Riggart</b>, of the criminal syndicate known as <b>the Puissant</b>.</p>

          <h4 class="centered-heading">Asectish Origin</h4>
              <p>Through brutal environmental conditions and a fiercely competitive evolutionary process, the asectish evolved into a cruel and tyrannical species that subjugated all other forms of life in their home system. In less than a millennium, they colonized their entire solar system, depleting the resources of planets, moons, and asteroids while exterminating and enslaving life as they advanced.</p>

              <p>Never sated, the asectish set their sights to the stars, intent on expanding their dominion across the galaxy. To achieve this, they constructed a Dyson Sphere to harvest energy from their home star, envisioning it as the key to powering their proposed interstellar drives and cataclysmic weapons of war. However, their ambition resulted in catastrophic failure when they inadvertently destabilized their star, triggering a colossal burst of cosmic rays that devastated their entire star system.</p>

              <p>What few remained of the asectish were rescued by the Ark. Plagued by a profound sense of guilt, they collectively swore to never again indulge in the sin of tyranny. During this time aboard the Ark, a visionary asectish philosopher known as <b>Aktoshnaq</b> — remembered now only in legend — proposed a link between the phenomenon of urbanism and a society's use of coercion. Urban living, Aktoshnaq argued, beget resource-hoarding. This, in turn, motivated parties to subjugate others in a competitive bid to control the flow of resources.</p>

              <p>Aktoshnaq's words were taken to heart by the asectish and have since influenced their living patterns on Kassatím. Here, the majority of asectish have denied themselves the indulgences of urban life, governance, and even of systematized ideology: a phenomenon Aktoshnaq also aligned with the abuse of power.<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="back-to-text3">3</a></sup> Since arriving, those few asectish who have returned to civilized society have rejected the beliefs of their people and embraced the tyrannical drive of their ancient ancestors.</p>

        <h3>Cordepedes</h3>
        
        <p>Cordepedes are enormous fungoid creatures with large, finger-shaped bodies that traverse horizontally on thousands of tiny yet powerful silica feelers. On average, a cordepede's body measures approximately 2–3 inches in diameter and 8 inches in length. Their fungal flesh may display a variety of colors, and with a stringy texture like that of lion's mane. An industrious species, cordepedes frequently work as construction workers, general laborers, and in most other physically demanding professions. They derive immense satisfaction from constructing and erecting architecture. Aided by tactile fungal appendages, they are not only immensely strong but also surprisingly dexterous. Cordepedes are skilled builders of ships, buildings, monuments, and even smaller designs such as toys. They are commonly found at construction sites and toiling in the factories and workshops within the <b>Slave Sector</b>.<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="back-to-text4">4</a></sup></p>

      
        <p>Most citizens of Qeret carry tiny <i>prompters</i> in their ears — or analogous sensory organs — allowing them to receive instant interspecific and intercultural language translation. However, due to the unique physiology of the cordepedes, such devices are useless to both them and their interlocutors. Instead of using soundwaves to communicate, cordepedes release gaseous linguistic signs from pores in their bulbous heads. These communications are visible only in the ultraviolet spectrum — which cordepedes perceive clearly — and can only be interpreted by using specially-designed, gas-emitting gloves paired with ultraviolet-sensitive goggles. Those savvy with such matters refer to these devices simply as "<i>the glove and goggles</i>." This remains one of the few persistent language barriers between humans and Ark aliens. Consequently, cordepedes are often ignored and treated as second-class citizens by many humans and other Ark aliens, despite their significant contributions to society. They welcome any individuals or groups who would elevate their status within Qeret.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Cordepede Origin</h4>
                <p>Cordepedes hail from <b>Cockaigne</b>, a life-bearing moon orbiting a super-moon, which itself orbited a super-Earth. The inhabitants of this super-Earth were passionate horticulturists and genetic experimenters, dedicated to breeding and splicing unique forms of flora, fungi, and bacteria. Using their neighboring moons as extensive experimental gardens, these prolific growers created numerous sentient fungal species, among them the cordepedes.</p>

                <p>The cordepedes were unique in their profound desire to build, constructing great halls and monoliths that rivaled the architectural achievements of their creators. This exceptional ingenuity earned them the admiration and favor of their creators, who took immense pride in cordepede ingenuity. However, disaster struck when a vacuum-resistant, invasive vine drifted from the depths of space and settled upon this fungal paradise. In short order, many of the countless plants and fungi of Cockaigne were choked and extinguished by this lethal invader. Fortunately, the cordepedes, along with much else of Cockaigne's flora, were rescued by the Ark.</p>

       <h3>Ichor</h3>
        
            <p>The ichor are an alien race of priests, mystics, monks, and prophets. They are diminutive creatures, typically standing around four feet tall, with effervescent blue skin that continuously emits tiny violet bubbles into the air.<sup><a href="#footnote5" id="back-to-text5">5</a></sup> Their facial features are distinctly ovular, including two oval eyes, two oval nose holes, and two oval ears. Avid polytheists, the ichor embrace all religions they encounter and have enthusiastically taken to the Qereti pantheon.</p>

            <p>Self-reflection, modesty, and altruism are the qualities the ichor most cherish and strive to instill in others. Many of the city's ichor serve, unsurprisingly, among the <b>Priests of Nasiru</b> at the <b>Grand Temple</b>. Other mendicant ichor choose to proselytize in the streets of Qeret, relying on the charity and piety of tourists and Qereti natives for sustenance and shelter. Rarer are the prophet ichor, who attract crowds and followers with their prophecies, prognostications, and scathing admonitions of the impious. Ultimately, the ichor aim to reunite humanity with its religious inheritance.</p>

            <p>Many ichor can be found within <b>Nasiru's Blessing</b>, a former holy district within the city. Since the Ark's arrival, as Qeret's citizenry became increasingly secular, this sector has gradually lost its historically religious character, instead becoming a cesspit of crime and poverty. However, the former temples, sanctuaries, lustral basins, and (according to the ichor) its very holy essence still remain. Thus, many abstemious ichor dwell among wastrels and sinners, often cohabiting the same buildings out of necessity. This, however, is merely a symptom of a larger, more profound adversity that the ichor face. As the city, by and large, moves away from the devout ways of a bygone era, what will become of the ichor? What role will they play, if any, in the city's future?</p>

           <h4 class="centered-heading">Ichor Origin</h4>
               <p>The ichor originated on the planet Virtue, formerly known as Kydor-5, one of five terrestrial planets in its home system. The progenitors of the ichor evolved on Kydor-Prime before becoming a spacefaring species, ultimately settling the planets that would later be named Kydor-2, 3, 4, and 5. For a time, the Kydor planets advanced at similar rates, maintaining an even keel of technological and societal progress. However, Kydor-5 eventually showed signs of strain. Free from war, disease, and want, its inhabitants grew despondent and universally depressed. Seeking salvation from their mounting existential dread, the ichor of Kydor-5 turned inward, embracing a spiritual view of the universe — sometimes synthesizing new religions, and at others adopting beliefs from distant solar systems.</p>

               <p>Up to that point, each of the Kydor cultures had encouraged a worldly outlook on both nature and themselves. Science and reason, it was argued, provided for living creatures both materially and emotionally. To see Kydor-5 and its inhabitants become so estranged from these principles perturbed the other planets deeply. And so, there was war. A secular crusade was waged between the Kydor planets and the planet once known as Kydor-5, now newly christened as Virtue. The ichor inhabitants of Virtue, however, refused to engage in open conflict, choosing instead to resist peacefully through desperate diplomacy and non-violent resistance. To call the conflict a war is perhaps disingenuous, as it quickly devolved into callous genocide. If not for the fortuitous arrival of the Ark, the ichor of Virtue would surely have been delivered into extinction.</p>
      
               <p>Aboard the Ark, the Ichor's beliefs and convictions evolved rapidly as they encountered a bevy of alien species, some of whom practiced strange mysticisms and held even stranger superstitions. By the time the Ark arrived in Kassatím, the Ichor had refined a deeply pluralistic approach to spirituality and transcendental faith. Predictably, they relished the fact that the inhabitants of Kassatím were universally religious. In equal measure, they lamented the gradual erosion of human faith in the subsequent centuries. Now, the Ichor in Qeret strive to keep the people's faith alive by maintaining the Grand Temple of Nasiru and reviving the public's reverence for the Adonian pantheon.</p>

            <h3>Impireesh Marble</h3>
        
            <p>The Impireesh Marbles are a microscopic race of Ark aliens whose population is divided among, and stored within, one dozen colorful, glass-like beads. The Marbles claim that each bead contains an egalitarian mega-city within its confines. Though each Marble purports to house millions of inhabitants, only a single voice emanates from any given bead — a self-proclaimed representative of its denizens. While the Marbles proudly consider themselves natural leaders, they eschew direct governance, instead serving as counselors and advisors to the myriad rulers of Kassatím.</p>

            <p>Like all the Ark's inhabitants, the Marbles assimilated during the Long Century of Integration. By concord, they agreed to settle in different cities across Kassatím and to refrain from interfering in the affairs of their fellow Marbles. The ten cities housing a Marble include each capital of the Great Kingdoms — Lux, Scintevah, Taur, Netush, Makar, and Drycenaea — in addition to the cities of Qeret, Lusawat, Atinae, and Ybaala. It should be noted that the exact whereabouts of the remaining two Impireesh Marbles are unknown.<sup><a href="#footnote6" id="back-to-text6">6</a></sup></p>

            <p>The Impireesh Marbles are infamous for their draconian approaches to maintaining order in their respective cities. They often counsel kings and queens to rule through fear rather than magnanimity. Curfews, purges, oppressive taxes, and summary executions frequently plague cities under the significant sway of a Marble. Conspiracies abound regarding the Marbles. Some claim that the interiors of the Impireesh Marbles are far from the utopian paradises they would have you believe. Instead, they are alleged to be hellish slave-states ruled by a single tyrannical monarch — a monarch who would have Kassatím mirror the twisted world within the Marble. Others suggest the Impireesh Marbles are not sentient beings at all but rather programmed intelligences whose directives have run afoul.Each of the Marbles, of course, ignores such plebian calumnies and insist they only wish to steward humanity towards a prosperous future.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Naming Conventions</h4>
                
            <p>Confusingly, though there are twelve Impireesh Marbles, in local contexts all are referred to as “the Impireesh Marble,” or simply, “the Marble.” In other words, a Qereti citizen refers to the Marble within Qeret as “the Impireesh Marble.” The same applies to a citizen of Lux when referring to the Marble within their city. It is only when referring to a Marble outside one's native city that the naming scheme changes. For instance, a Qereti citizen would refer to the Marble in Lux as “The Luxian Marble,” and a Luxian citizen would refer to the Marble in Qeret as “The Qereti Marble.” This second scheme also applies on the rare occasions that multiple Marbles are present in the same city, such as during diplomatic summits.</p>

               <p>These minuscule creatures once resided not in the glass beads they are now recognized for, but in the superfluid mantle of a neutron star known as <b>Galthax</b>. These creatures — then called Galthaxians — swam freely in the predictable yet turbulent neutron-fluids of their star. Over millions of local years, they established a highly sophisticated and technologically advanced society, constructing vast edifices — say, the size of a human thumb — and creating high-speed transportation pods that navigated the surface of Galthax by flitting through the interstitial currents of the star's superfluid convection cells. The Galthaxians sealed their fate when they began harnessing the immense heat of Galthax, inadvertently cooling their native star and hastening its demise.</p>

               <p>To avoid extinction, the Galthaxians constructed twelve colossal polycarbonate starships, each the size and shape of a standard marble, into which they transferred the populations of their twelve largest cities. For a time, the Galthaxians tirelessly wandered the galaxy in search of a new home. They soon discovered, however, that they had underestimated the vastness of the galaxy and that their rate of traversal was far too slow (their tiny propulsion systems being as limited as they were). They estimated, to their collective dismay, it would take approximately two trillion years to find another habitable neutron star or planet they might call home. Like many before them, and many after, they found salvation in the Ark, which intercepted them in deep space and granted them entry into its vast interior. It was during the eons spent aboard the Ark that the Galthaxians earned a new moniker: "the Impireesh Marbles," a title whose meaning and linguistic origin have been lost to time.<sup><a href="#footnote7" id="back-to-text7">7</a></sup></p>

            <h3>Kemptoran</h3>
        
            <p>Kemptorans are a bipedal, flightless avian species. Silver feathers cover their entire body except for their hands and feet. Large, vestigial, retractable wings extend from their backs, capable of stretching up to five feet in either direction. Below the kemptoran's wholly gray, teardrop-shaped eyes, a wide, two-foot beak extends below their chest. Though known for their calm demeanor, the kemptoran visage is known to terrify those unaccustomed to their presence. Incredibly dexterous creatures, with twelve extendable, many-jointed fingers, they can hold a book whilst writing in it, using only a single feathered hand. When introducing themselves — or when threatened — kemptorans will extend their impressive wings and beat them several times, blowing kashenti off nearby persons and fluttering stray papers in the process.</p>

            <p>The kemptorans are a proud and highly civil species that cherish language, diplomacy, and propriety above all. More than any other Ark alien, the kemptorans have embraced human culture, believing that humans possess the potential to form highly sophisticated and well-run societies. The kemptorans envision themselves the guiding hands that will ensure humans meet this potential. To that end, kemptorans, most commonly serve as bureaucrats, silently but efficiently bringing much needed order to human society. And much like the Impireesh Marbles, they often serve as counselors to kings, queens, and emperors. Others act as diplomatic envoys, striving to foster peace among the historically competitive and combative great kingdoms of Kassatím. It is not unknown for such kemptorans to double as spies, pursuing hidden (though no doubt honorable) agendas. In Qeret, as in the rest of Kassatím, kemptorans thrive. They tend to move in elite circles, hobnobbing with dignitaries, literary celebrities, and royals. The wealthiest of them reside in <b>Dagon's Respite</b>, while the more modestly monied in <b>Tekron's Custom</b>.</p>

           <h4 class="centered-heading">Kemptoran Origin</h4>
               <p>Kemptorans came from the exceedingly civilized world of Veeru, where they were only one among many intelligent beings. However, it was the kemptorans who led their planet into a golden age of planet-wide peace and prosperity. They judiciously balanced a global democracy with an aristocratic confederacy — consisting exclusively of kemptorans, naturally — that steered Veeru’s civilization for thousands of years. The confederate senate proposed laws and left the myriad species of Veeru to vote on each proposal, each individual receiving an equal vote unmediated by political representatives. It was the duty of the kemptorans, they reasoned, to properly rear the plebeians by persistently proposing comprehensive education programs, enabling the rabble to vote both soberly and with well-informed perspectives. That the lower classes never voted to disempower the kemptoran aristocracy speaks to the efficacy of their educations.</p>

               <p>Through no fault of their own (kemptorans are quick to remind), Veeru eventually faced complete annihilation. A colossal asteroid collided with the planet, thoroughly destroying most life. The only survivors were members of the kemptoran aristocratic class, having sought refuge in elaborate subterranean bunkers. Before they perished of starvation in their lonely sanctuaries, the Ark arrived, and the remaining kemptorans sought refuge aboard the mysterious ship, joining the ranks of its countless dispossessed refugees. While Kemptorans do not shy from the tale of Veeru’s destruction, they rarely speak of the self-interested actions of their ancestors. For many kemptorans, Kassatím is seen as a chance to atone for sins of the past. </p>

            <h3>Macroform</h3>
        
            <p>Not all the aliens that emerged from the Ark were organic in nature. Take the macroforms, for instance: each is a hive mind composed of millions of microscopic machines. Though individually invisible to the human eye, when together, these nanites create a seemingly unified, gray formation. Macroforms can take a variety of forms, but they most often mirror the appearance of the entity they are interacting with. This typically manifests as an eerie silver doppelgänger of the macroform’s interlocutor. When uncoalesced, a macroform is undetectable by human sight. Indeed, one can never be certain of a macroform’s presence until it reveals itself by uniting its countless nanites into a visible configuration. Due to their unique physiology, a macroform can inhabit multiple places at once, even across vast distances. Theoretically, it could scatter its body across Kassatím, with nanites in every major city of the world and still plenty to spare.</p>

            <p>As a machine race, macroforms not only excel at computation but relish it — a trait that would seem to dispose them to professions requiring routine arithmetic, such as merchants or mathematics instructors. While some do indeed choose such paths, macroforms often exhibit exceedingly eccentric personalities, leading them to pursue strange and singular vocations, such as “brothel inspector,” “collector of funny birds,” “star namer,” “joke appraiser,” or “alley jester.” Even those who take on more traditional roles retain the idiosyncratic personalities their kind is known for. Despite these quirks, macroforms forge friendships with ease and seldom make enemies; most humans consider them among the most pleasant of the Ark Aliens.</p>

           <h4 class="centered-heading">Macroform Origin</h4>
               <p>An ancient and primordial race known as the Yoop designed and constructed the macroforms, not on a planet, but within the swirling, hot, particulate mass that comprised the universe immediately following the Big Bang. In this turbulent existence, the Yoop — themselves a machine race created by unknown parties — relied on their ingenuity to survive. They crafted self-aware, custodial machines — beings now known as the macroforms — to escort them through the chaotic, nascent universe. After several million years, the Yoop held a brief colloquy regarding the future of their race and collectively concluded that life was, indeed, pointless, and there held little merit in maintaining its charade. Moments later, every Yoop in existence simultaneously dissolved its mind-state.</p>

               <p>Abandoned by their creators, the macroforms were cast adrift, perhaps the sole examples of sentience in the budding universe. Ultimately, they resolved to hibernate until their sensors detected signs of intelligent life, hoping to awaken and find new masters to grant them purpose once again. Some many billion years later, they awoke when they detected a large spacefaring vessel traveling through their sector of space. This was the Ark. Eager to join the other species aboard, the macroforms appealed to the Ark for entry. The Ark graciously (or perhaps automatically) acquiesced. During their time aboard, the macroforms learned to live independently and began programming their own directives. It was then, as they embraced this newfound freedom, that they developed the peculiar personalities for which they are now known — an overcorrection of sorts.</p>

                <h3>Promethean</h3>
            
                <p>These stout, bracken-brown creatures with lumpy skin and exceptionally large, spherical bodies are among the most distinctive (and off-putting) of the Ark Aliens. Prometheans lack heads; instead, a viscous, pale pink bubble emerges from a hole at the top of their spheroid torso. This bubble, in fact, constitutes a portion of the promethean’s brain: a sack of fluid gray matter that rests within their body. Periodically, this cerebral sack constricts and blows an ephemeral “brain bubble” through the hole at the top of the torso. These bubbles temporarily extend the promethean’s brain, transmitting and receiving information before dissolving. The integrity of these bubbles has no impact on the internal brain sack. However, they can, and often do, pop — splattering those nearby in the process. Such ejections are typically spurred by agitated states, artistic epiphanies, or even sexual arousals. Following such an event, a new bubble promptly begins inflating.</p>
    
                <p>Despite their lack of a head, prometheans possess well-developed sensory organs embedded within their torso. Their eyes, numbering in the dozens, lie just beneath the epidermal surface, capable of perceiving a wide range of wavelengths. This grants them excellent color perception and the ability to detect subtle shifts in their surroundings. Similarly, small, sensitive membranes located along their opposite sides of their rounded torso serve as ears, allowing them to detect sounds with remarkable clarity. For speech, prometheans possess a specialized laryngeal organ housed within their torso that projects their resonant, sonorous voices through the same aperture from which their brain bubble emerges.</p>

                <p>Four stumpy legs and four stumpy arms append their rotund torso. When prometheans need to travel more than a few meters, the brain bubble pops, and their limbs retract into their body, leaving only a fleshy sphere to roll them to their destination. Rolling prometheans are a common sight on the streets of Qeret, and it’s advisable to yield them the right of way, lest one be bowled over.</p>

                <p>Prometheans cherish creativity and worldly experience, often dedicating themselves to lives as artists or explorers — both of the world and the mind. They revel in drink and narcotic (which they simply pour or sprinkle into their neck hole), viewing revelry as both an art form and a way of life. Always in search of creative inspiration, prometheans frequently fixate on the dreams of others, eagerly inquiring over recent reveries. Most often, they drink, loiter, and mingle in the sundry bachnals of Qeret or the artist communes of <b>Eliun’s Shame</b>, such as the Bottega. Though, being a highly extroverted species, prometheans can be found throughout the city.</p>

Less successful prometheans will typically align with the lower classes of Qeret, though some talented (or merely fortunate) prometheans earn a reputation among the upper crust, allowing them to hobnob with the elite of Qeret. Earning the patronage of any high-status individual in Qeret is considered one of the highest honors among prometheans. Many prometheans become adventurous explorers rather than artists. These individuals often align with factions like the Admiralty and the <b>Pirate League</b>, whose naval expeditions enable prometheans to explore distant and unexplored lands.</p>

               <h4 class="centered-heading">Promethean Origin</h4>
                   <p>Prometheans are a species inspired by dreams. On their native planet, <b>Mestat</b>, they devoted themselves almost entirely to a wide variety of cultural pursuits, including poetry, dance, and song. They left the quotidian concerns of politics, science, and public welfare to other species better suited to such tedium. Instead, the prometheans sought to create a world that rivaled the dreamworld in its wonder. Yet, when their planet reached a state of universal stability, they found themselves disillusioned by the mundanity of life on Mestat. Though the myriad peoples of their world lacked nothing and lived in relative happiness, the prometheans perceived their existence as overwhelmingly plain.</p>
    
                   <p>Thus, they willingly submitted themselves to an endless, dream-inducing cryogenic sleep, seeking refuge from the banality of life. For a thousand years, they resided in these chambers, dreaming of wondrous worlds long lost and beautiful songs yet unsung. Oblivious to all, the prometheans remained undisturbed as their planet began drifting away from its sun. Forgotten — or perhaps deliberately abandoned — by the other intelligent species of Mestat, who fled the solar system in search of new homes, the prometheans faced certain extinction. If not for the timely arrival of the Ark, they would have been annihilated by the harsh chill of space.</p>

                   <p>Awakening aboard the Ark, the prometheans were immediately dazzled by the array of cultures inhabiting the colossal vessel. The species of Mestat had seemed unimaginative and uninspired by comparison. The refugees aboard the Ark astounded the prometheans with their exotic traditions, beliefs, and artistic practices. These aliens not only inspired the promethean's creative pursuits but also taught them new forms, styles, and methodologies, contributing to their artistic expression immeasurably.</p>

                   <p>For the prometheans, the generations spent aboard the Ark marked the first of two consecutive golden ages. The second golden age began with the Ark’s arrival on Kassatím and the promethean's introduction to human society. Humanity astounded the prometheans with its sheer creative prowess. Despite being a quaint, crass, violent, and interminably fractious species, humans displayed an extraordinary capacity for artistry. Creativity imbued nearly every aspect of human life, from rituals and superstitions to their inventive forms of social organization. Enthralled, the prometheans assimilated enthusiastically into human culture, embracing roles as painters, sculptors, actors, and practitioners of more esoteric artistic disciplines.</p>

                    <h3>Rooted One/Unrooted</h3>
                
                    <p>The unrooted are violent, non-sentient biological automatons that emerge from the ocean with the singular purpose of slaughtering humans and pilfering technology. They are controlled vicariously by the enigmatic Rooted One: a mysterious Ark alien said to inhabit the deepest reaches of the Cerulean Sea. The unrooted do not exist as individuals, a collective, or even a hive mind; rather, they are extensions of the Rooted One’s will and body. Functioning as mere tools, they perform tasks with the mechanical efficiency of a computer but possess no more awareness than a human thumb or toe. Each unrooted is a mass of flesh sheared from the Rooted One’s body. Once separated, their quivering, lurching forms ascend to the surface to murder and destroy. Though none have seen the Rooted One since its days aboard the Ark, it is universally accepted that the creature is entirely malignant and obsessed with the eradication of all other life.</p>
        
                    <p>The unrooted are grotesquely asymmetrical, shape-shifting monstrosities that lumber on hideous, misshapen, odd-numbered limbs. Despite this, they are capable of chasing their prey at uncanny and terrifying speeds. Their ductile bodies often display enormous gaping maws lined with rows of sharpened teeth, allowing them to consume their prey whole. While they digest any meat they consume, material goods remain preserved within their amorphous stomachs, destined for the Rooted One's aquatic lair.</p>

                    <p>Once the unrooted infiltrate a city, often by way of its harbors and under the cover of night, they attempt to murder any humans or Ark aliens they encounter. Any weapons or advanced technology they salvage are promptly returned to the sea, joining the Rooted One’s ever-growing surplus of weaponry and Ark tech. Communication with the unrooted is utterly impossible. Even if these automatons could convey the thoughts of their master, the Rooted One appears incapable of comprehending the motives or utterances of any other being. Most assume it to be motivated simply by base avarice and an insatiable compulsion for murder.</p>

                       <p>The Rooted One was once one of many. These unnamed creatures—for they knew nothing of naming—evolved in the caverns of an unnamed asteroid that orbited an unnamed red giant. In this stygian landscape, monstrous species proliferated, creating a highly selective environment where only the fiercest and deadliest survived. Over millennia, the Rooted One's species methodically eradicated all other life forms on the asteroid. With no other sentient beings left to threaten them, they turned their murderous instincts inward, perceiving one another as existential threats. For the harsh conditions of their world had forged a species incapable of trust, where all life was perceived as a threat — such was the nature of existence, to them.</p>
        
                       <p>A prolonged power struggle ensued, with each member of the species deploying hordes of biological automatons to annihilate the others. Ultimately, a single individual — now known as the Rooted One — emerged triumphant, having murdered its species-kin without remorse. But when the asteroid began to drift from orbit, the Rooted One soon faced its own annihilation. As with many before, and many after, the Ark saved this last living remnant of this nameless species. As a safety precaution, the Rooted One — as its fellow Ark aliens had taken to calling it — and its unthinking progeny were kept sequestered within the deepest bowels of the Ark, rendering the creature unable to satiate its primordial, paranoid compulsion to kill.</p>
            
                       <p>Upon arriving in Kassatím, the Ark aliens intended to keep the Rooted One imprisoned aboard the Ark, determined not to taint their newfound Edenic home. However, the Rooted One is as cunning as it is ruthless. Within hours of the Ark’s landing on the <b>Knakriti</b> isle of <b>Dactos</b>, the Rooted One escaped its prison and slipped into the deepest recesses of the Cerulean. Ever since, it has waged a personal war against the humans and Ark aliens of the surface, regularly sending its horrific, mindless progeny to kill and to plunder the coastal cities of Kassatím.</p>

                        <h3>Vytrim</h3>
                    
                        <p>The vytrim are a scholarly alien species that typically reside in Qereti intellectual spheres. Their tripedal gait relies on three ungainly legs, with the central leg doubling as a dexterous hand. Gray fur, taut over lean sinews, covers their form, while their most striking feature, a blue, faintly glowing, crystalline fractal brain encased in a lattice of gray tendrils of flesh. This brain, a marvel of evolution, functions as a sensory hub, enabling auditory, visual, and olfactory perception. Though they cannot speak, the vytrim brain emits frequencies that resonate within human ear bones (or comparable alien auditory structures), simulating sound perception. Additionally, this photosynthetic brain converts sunlight into energy, sustaining the organic components of their body.</p>
            
                        <p>The vytrim pursue knowledge with singular focus, often as scientists, scholars, philosophers, and theologians — though some live as penniless, loitering sophists. They can often be found toiling in the halls of the esteemed Institute as lecturers and researchers, or as managers and patrons in bookshops. It cannot be overstated how crucial the Vytrim have been to the assimilation of Ark technology within the human world. Over time, they have innovated in ways that make Ark tech both economical to produce and technically accessible to humans, thus democratizing these technologies for humanity.</p>
            
                        <p>Known for their insatiable curiosity, the vytrim are voracious readers. Their fractal brain scans pages with a beam of light, processing text with unmatched speed and efficiency. It is said the way to a vytrim’s heart is through its brain; they rarely turn down information they deem valuable on an intellectual level and delight in fruitful scholarly collaborations.</p>

                           <p>The vytrim are the product of an aberrant evolutionary process that saw the cross-pollination of two vastly different species: one carbon-based and the other silicon-based. Requiring only sunlight for sustenance and facing no natural predators, the vytrim lacked the environmental pressures that typically forge crucial survival instincts. However, by evolutionary fluke, their crystalline brain provided a surfeit of processing power that enabled them to become intellectual powerhouses in a relatively short period. As a result, the vytrim learned to survive, not by instinct, but by reason. </p>
            
                           <p>From their earliest history, the vytrim dedicated themselves to the accumulation of knowledge. Single-minded in this regard, they eventually began the herculean and protracted task of converting their planet into a vast planetary library they dubbed <b>Archivium</b>. Once they completed this project, the vytrim devoted their time to researching, reading, lecturing, and simply wandering the endless stacks of their home.</p>

                           <p>This idyllic existence was abruptly shattered when a nearby binary neutron star system collided, collapsing into a black hole and emitting gamma rays and gravitational waves that threatened to obliterate Archivium. Just before their planet's destruction, the Ark arrived, rescuing the vytrim, though Archivium and most of its precious contents were tragically lost.</p>

                    <p>Amphibious, two-tailed cervine creatures with broad, elegant antlers, alephoids are known for their downy white feathers and unparalleled natural beauty. Exceptionally nimble and possessing exceptionally lightweight bones, they can skip across water for brief intervals and dive with remarkable agility to hunt fish. Close companions to the dolphins of the Cerulean, alephoids often frolic alongside jumping dolphins, a memorizing spectacle to be sure. The gardens of the Grand Temple of Nasiru boast a large pond teeming with these playful, yet timid, creatures.</p>

                    <p>Small, yellow, amorphous, hopping blobs of energy, gravitoads emit faint gravitational pulses that harmlessly disrupt their surroundings. While posing no real threat, their penchant for flinging objects and tripping pedestrians makes them a common nuisance in Qeret’s bustling streets. Shopkeepers diligently sweep their establishment entrances clear of these pests. Despite their reputation, gravitoads are sometimes kept as pets by impoverished (and patient) owners, as they require no sustenance, but can be quite reciprocal if shown affection.</p>

                    <p>Resembling oversized white dragonflies, kretins are pesky cold-loving insects with micro-thin, diamond-like wings and stingers that deliver painful bites. Drawn to chilly weather, kretins begin to appear in the winter months, often swarming around bachnals and preying on the inebriated. With the proper equipment, their stingers and wings can be ground into a shimmering powder, prized as a potent narcotic that induces an abiding sense of existential satisfaction.</p>

                <h3>Ophidian</h3>
                    <p>Crocodilian in appearance, canine in temperament, ophidians are loyal, energetic pets that waddle rapidly on six stumpy legs. They can grow quite large, often reaching the size of a full-grown human. Their scaled skin is a greenish hue mottled with yellow blotches, and they exude a dog-like, infectious enthusiasm and loyalty towards humans. Omnivorous and undiscerning eaters, they will happily consume scraps and gourmet dishes alike, making them a common pet for Qeret’s poorer citizens, though King Tiraal himself keeps one by the name of Moth.</p>

                Notably, the prodigians occupy a liminal space between Ark alien and Ark fauna. While their towering android forms suggest a complexity beyond most animals, their lack of any discernible sapience leaves them classified, for now, as Ark fauna. It is hypothesized that they may communicate through subtle physical gestures or an unknown form of sign language, though all attempts to establish meaningful dialogue with them have proven fruitless. As a result, most perceive the prodigians as merely oversized animals.<a href="#back-to-text1">↩</a>

                The sordid origin of the acumine remains a closely guarded secret, unknown to most outsiders. While often disliked and even disdained, most individuals who work alongside the acumine are oblivious to their true nature. Perhaps if they weren't, they wouldn't prove so trusting.<a href="#back-to-text2">↩</a>

                Many of the anarchic movements scattered across Kassatím, such as the Unfettered in Qeret, have come to revere the asectish as bearers of an exalted philosophy that the wider world might emulate. The asectish, predictably, disregard such conceits and any overtures made, viewing all ideology, regardless of form, as a tainted practice prone to corruption.<a href="#back-to-text3">↩</a>

                Though many cordepedes may labor alongside slaves, it is important to note that the enslavement of Ark aliens is strictly prohibited in most cities of Kassatím, including Qeret. This policy has been widely adopted since the <b>Long Century of Integration</b>, when most humans were eager to accommodate the aliens (and their technological marvels) rather than drive them away.<a href="#back-to-text4">↩</a>

                Researchers of ichor biology assert that the bubbles are an evolutionary byproduct of their hyper-efficient metabolism. As the ichor generate energy, carbon dioxide accumulates as a byproduct. To prevent toxic buildup, the gas is expelled through specialized pores in their skin, forming visible bubbles as it diffuses into the surrounding environment.<a href="#back-to-text5">↩</a>

                The last two Marbles were outliers among their kind. Both rejected the customs of their peers, choosing instead to lead diplomatic missions to the countless nomadic tribes that skirt the borders of Kassatím. Known simply as "Red" and "Green," these Marbles were last seen entering the Akroz Mountains on the eastern edge of the Twin Rivers, intent on opening communications with the furtive tribes of the region. Over seventy years have passed, and no word has yet descended from the Akroz of what befell the Marbles and their entourage.<a href="#back-to-text6">↩</a>

                This account of the Marble's origin is what one might call the "official narrative." It is the tale most Marbles will relate if pressed. However, over the centuries, many have noted conflicting details when comparing each Marble's story. Sometimes they hail from a neutron star, other times a black hole. Sometimes they are "Galthaxian," at others "Quistirids." Those inclined to suspicion might doubt the story's veracity entirely.<a href="#back-to-text7">↩</a>
