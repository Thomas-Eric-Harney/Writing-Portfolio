        <p>A wide variety of Ark species inhabit Qeret and the wider world of <b>Kassatím</b>. For our purposes, they have been divided into three types: Ark alien, Ark fauna, and Ark flora. The criteria for each type are as such:</p>

        <p><b>Ark Aliens</b>: Sentient and self-aware creatures capable of communication.</p>

        <p><b>Ark Fauna</b>: Sentient, though non-sapient and noncommunicative, though some exceptions to the latter two may exist.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup></p>  
        
        <p><b>Ark Flora</b>: Non-sentient plant and fungal life.</p>

        <p>This chapter is not intended to form a comprehensive list of all Ark species in Qeret — and certainly not Kassatím — but merely the most prevalent in the city, its caverns, and the <b>Bamati Plains</b>. In Appendix B, GMs may find further aliens to populate their game should the need arise.</p>

        <h3 class="centered-heading">Ark Aliens and Archetypes</h3>

        <p>Though I have attributed archetypal motivations and characteristics to each of the Ark aliens, these should be treated as general guidelines. Ark aliens can be just as idiosyncratic as any human; GMs are encouraged to distinguish their Ark alien NPCs with unique character traits, habits, and interests. In my own campaigns, I've introduced sensitive acumine, pacifist Marbles, and even talkative asectish. Such NPCs can pleasantly surprise players accustomed to what a species ostensibly “is,” while adding greater narrative depth.</p>
        
        <p>This kind of flexibility will not only enrich your narrative, but also forge a sense of verisimilitude, reminding players that Ark aliens — like humans — are complex and multifaceted beings.</p>

        <p>Finally, GMs should feel free to disregard any lore they feel is irrelevant or ill-suited to their group. While some players might enjoy delving into the origins of a species, others may not. Cater to your table.</p>

   <h3>Acumine</h3>
        <p>The unscrupulous acumine relish human discord and misery. Tall, skeletal, and bipedal, they possess distended foreheads and tight ginger skin that accentuates their ghoulish features. A single darting eye rests upon their forehead, betraying a cruel intelligence. Fiercely individualistic, acumine nearly always work alone, avoiding collaboration with others. They rarely conspire with other acumine and never share the spoils of their exploits. While they may have "peers" within a faction, an acumine's motivations are their own, aligning with others only when it serves their interests.</p>

      
          <p>Considering their unsavory reputation, one might expect the Acumine to be outcasts in society. In reality, they are found in most social spheres, often occupying positions of power and influence. They might serve as minor crime lords in the underworld or advisors in royal courts, offering sage — though frequently devious — counsel to kings and queens. They secure these positions by providing what others need, whether it be advanced technology, vital information, or unsavory favors that most respectable humans or Ark aliens would never consider. The price for such "gifts" is invariably steep, and many who underestimate the Acumine's capacity for cruelty pay dearly for it. Nevertheless, by making themselves indispensable assets to their patrons, the Acumine ensure they are not only tolerated but depended upon.</p>

          <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
   <p>As an individualistic species with little to no ideological tethers, acumine can be found among most of the major factions in Qeret. Most notable is <b>Maal</b> of the <b>Ark Sodality</b> and the famous poet, <b>Zygo the Wag</b>, of the <b>Qereti Court</b>.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Acumine Origin</h4>
                <p>For millennia, the home planet of the acumine, <b>Fiamon-7</b>, was ruled by unfeeling machines whose primary technological resource was life itself. These machines designed, created, and relied on biological entities much in the way that humans build and use inanimate tools. Each biotic creation was genetically tailored to perform its designated duties flawlessly, with an inherent drive to fulfill their role, as natural to them as the human need for water.</p>

                <p>Such callous exploitation of life inevitably attracted the attention of galactic good Samaritans, sparking a cold war that engulfed Fiamon-7. Gradually, the machines began losing control of their planet to these foreign, do-gooding interlopers. In desperation, they engineered the acumine — a new form of living technology, imbued with a unique biological imperative: to take pleasure in the pain and suffering of other living creatures.</p>

                <p>The acumine were designed with two purposes in mind: first, to torture and extract information from enemy agents, and second, to intimidate and terrify interlopers. Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the acumine turned on their creators. Within a century, they had destroyed their makers by inciting internal conflict among them and dismantling the network-ecosystems their creators relied upon to survive.</p>

                <p>This apparent victory for biological life on Fiamon-7 was tragically short-lived. Without the machines to carefully regulate and sustain the planet's organic ecosystems, Fiamon-7 descended into a chaotic hellscape. Over-predation, environmental collapse, and episodes of mass suicide eventually left the world stripped of organic life. Was this the acumine's intention all along? Probably. Regardless, the Ark intervened, retrieving the few remaining species — including the acumine, in its indiscriminatory fashion — before the planet's biosphere was lost entirely.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="back-to-text2">2</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Asectish</h3>
        <p>The asectish are a bipedal, insectoid species with a bioluminescent exoskeleton composed of layers of serrated chiton. With hulking frames that stand on average 10 feet tall and 3 feet wide, the asectish — if encountered at all — can be quite intimidating. Their wide, praying mantis-like heads display two bulbous eyes resting above razor-sharp pincers. Though they navigate on two chitinous legs, the asectish have no arms but four powerful and malleable tentacles extending from their torsos. These tentacles enable them to readily grip tools, bodies, or each other, and each alone can lift four times the weight a human can.</p>

        <p>Asectish primarily reside in pastoral regions, typically laboring as farmers and shepherds. As such, they are rarely found within the confines of Qeret or any other city. Ever stoic, the asectish typically avoid contact with those outside their immediate kin system, though they generally feel a strong obligation to aid those in need. Being nocturnal creatures, they are seldom seen during the day, preferring to toil under the cover of night, their luminescent chitin emitting a soft glow that can be seen from a distance. </p>
        
        <p>The asectish shun society, rejecting all forms of hierarchy, bureaucracy, or governance, and instead cherish solitude, silence, and family above all else. However, if their kin are harmed, they will seek retribution without fail. Once roused, an asectish cannot be placated and will pursue vengeance to the end. Occasionally, some asectish deviate from the pastoralist ways of their people, instead choosing to integrate into urban society. These renegades are often drawn to positions of power, like moths to light.</p>

        <h4>Factional Associations</h4>
    <p>Though largely isolated, the asectish have inspired numerous pastoralist movements across Kassatím advocating for a return to nature and self-governance. Similarly, they are lionized by political movements like <b>the Unfettered</b>, who treat them as symbols of resistance and self-determination. However, most asectish reject any association with formal political organizations or ideologies, perceiving such systems as direct products of urban civilization and its moral corruptions.

    <p>As for urban asectish, though relatively rare, they can be found among some of Qeret's major factions. This includes <b>Hamil</b> of the <b>Seditionists</b>, and the master assassin, <b>Riggart</b>, of the criminal syndicate known as <b>the Puissant</b>.</p>

          <h4 class="centered-heading">Asectish Origin</h4>
              <p>Through brutal environmental conditions and a fiercely competitive evolutionary process, the asectish evolved into a cruel and tyrannical species that subjugated all other forms of life in their home system. In less than a millennium, they colonized their entire solar system, depleting the resources of planets, moons, and asteroids while exterminating and enslaving life as they advanced.</p>

              <p>Never sated, the asectish set their sights to the stars, intent on expanding their dominion across the galaxy. To achieve this, they constructed a Dyson Sphere to harvest energy from their home star, envisioning it as the key to powering their proposed interstellar drives and cataclysmic weapons of war. However, their ambition resulted in catastrophic failure when they inadvertently destabilized their star, triggering a colossal burst of cosmic rays that devastated their entire star system.</p>

              <p>What few remained of the asectish were rescued by the Ark. Plagued by a profound sense of guilt, they collectively swore to never again indulge in the sin of tyranny. During this time aboard the Ark, a visionary asectish philosopher known as <b>Aktoshnaq</b> — remembered now only in legend — proposed a link between the phenomenon of urbanism and a society's use of coercion. Urban living, Aktoshnaq argued, beget resource-hoarding. This, in turn, motivated parties to subjugate others in a competitive bid to control the flow of resources.</p>

              <p>Aktoshnaq's words were taken to heart by the asectish and have since influenced their living patterns on Kassatím. Here, the majority of asectish have denied themselves the indulgences of urban life, governance, and even of systematized ideology: a phenomenon Aktoshnaq also aligned with the abuse of power.<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="back-to-text3">3</a></sup> Since arriving, those few asectish who have returned to civilized society have rejected the beliefs of their people and embraced the tyrannical drive of their ancient ancestors.</p>

        <h3>Cordepedes</h3>
        
        <p>Cordepedes are enormous fungoid creatures with large, finger-shaped bodies that traverse horizontally on thousands of tiny yet powerful silica feelers. On average, a cordepede's body measures approximately 2–3 inches in diameter and 8 inches in length. Their fungal flesh may display a variety of colors, and with a stringy texture like that of lion's mane. An industrious species, cordepedes frequently work as construction workers, general laborers, and in most other physically demanding professions. They derive immense satisfaction from constructing and erecting architecture. Aided by tactile fungal appendages, they are not only immensely strong but also surprisingly dexterous. Cordepedes are skilled builders of ships, buildings, monuments, and even smaller designs such as toys. They are commonly found at construction sites and toiling in the factories and workshops within the <b>Slave Sector</b>.<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="back-to-text4">4</a></sup></p>

      
        <p>Most citizens of Qeret carry tiny <i>prompters</i> in their ears — or analogous sensory organs — allowing them to receive instant interspecific and intercultural language translation. However, due to the unique physiology of the cordepedes, such devices are useless to both them and their interlocutors. Instead of using soundwaves to communicate, cordepedes release gaseous linguistic signs from pores in their bulbous heads. These communications are visible only in the ultraviolet spectrum — which cordepedes perceive clearly — and can only be interpreted by using specially-designed, gas-emitting gloves paired with ultraviolet-sensitive goggles. Those savvy with such matters refer to these devices simply as "<i>the glove and goggles</i>." This remains one of the few persistent language barriers between humans and Ark aliens. Consequently, cordepedes are often ignored and treated as second-class citizens by many humans and other Ark aliens, despite their significant contributions to society. They welcome any individuals or groups who would elevate their status within Qeret.</p>

   <p>Naturally, cordepedes cultivate relationships with laborers and architects. Some of the few Qereti who use the aforementioned glove and goggles are such citizens, who must out of necessity. In addition, cordepedes maintain numerous contacts within the <b>Trader's Guild</b>, one of the few factions sympathetic to their plight. Notable cordepedes include <b>Odom</b> of the Ark Sodality and <b>Dryad</b> of the Unfettered.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Cordepede Origin</h4>
                <p>Cordepedes hail from <b>Cockaigne</b>, a life-bearing moon orbiting a super-moon, which itself orbited a super-Earth. The inhabitants of this super-Earth were passionate horticulturists and genetic experimenters, dedicated to breeding and splicing unique forms of flora, fungi, and bacteria. Using their neighboring moons as extensive experimental gardens, these prolific growers created numerous sentient fungal species, among them the cordepedes.</p>

                <p>The cordepedes were unique in their profound desire to build, constructing great halls and monoliths that rivaled the architectural achievements of their creators. This exceptional ingenuity earned them the admiration and favor of their creators, who took immense pride in cordepede ingenuity. However, disaster struck when a vacuum-resistant, invasive vine drifted from the depths of space and settled upon this fungal paradise. In short order, many of the countless plants and fungi of Cockaigne were choked and extinguished by this lethal invader. Fortunately, the cordepedes, along with much else of Cockaigne's flora, were rescued by the Ark.</p>

       <h3>Ichor</h3>
        
            <p>The ichor are an alien race of priests, mystics, monks, and prophets. They are diminutive creatures, typically standing around four feet tall, with effervescent blue skin that continuously emits tiny violet bubbles into the air.<sup><a href="#footnote5" id="back-to-text5">5</a></sup> Their facial features are distinctly ovular, including two oval eyes, two oval nose holes, and two oval ears. Avid polytheists, the ichor embrace all religions they encounter and have enthusiastically taken to the Qereti pantheon.</p>

            <p>Self-reflection, modesty, and altruism are the qualities the ichor most cherish and strive to instill in others. Many of the city's ichor serve, unsurprisingly, among the <b>Priests of Nasiru</b> at the <b>Grand Temple</b>. Other mendicant ichor choose to proselytize in the streets of Qeret, relying on the charity and piety of tourists and Qereti natives for sustenance and shelter. Rarer are the prophet ichor, who attract crowds and followers with their prophecies, prognostications, and scathing admonitions of the impious. Ultimately, the ichor aim to reunite humanity with its religious inheritance.</p>

            <p>Many ichor can be found within <b>Nasiru's Blessing</b>, a former holy district within the city. Since the Ark's arrival, as Qeret's citizenry became increasingly secular, this sector has gradually lost its historically religious character, instead becoming a cesspit of crime and poverty. However, the former temples, sanctuaries, lustral basins, and (according to the ichor) its very holy essence still remain. Thus, many abstemious ichor dwell among wastrels and sinners, often cohabiting the same buildings out of necessity. This, however, is merely a symptom of a larger, more profound adversity that the ichor face. As the city, by and large, moves away from the devout ways of a bygone era, what will become of the ichor? What role will they play, if any, in the city's future?</p>

           <h4 class="centered-heading">Ichor Origin</h4>
               <p>The ichor originated on the planet Virtue, formerly known as Kydor-5, one of five terrestrial planets in its home system. The progenitors of the ichor evolved on Kydor-Prime before becoming a spacefaring species, ultimately settling the planets that would later be named Kydor-2, 3, 4, and 5. For a time, the Kydor planets advanced at similar rates, maintaining an even keel of technological and societal progress. However, Kydor-5 eventually showed signs of strain. Free from war, disease, and want, its inhabitants grew despondent and universally depressed. Seeking salvation from their mounting existential dread, the ichor of Kydor-5 turned inward, embracing a spiritual view of the universe — sometimes synthesizing new religions, and at others adopting beliefs from distant solar systems.</p>

               <p>Up to that point, each of the Kydor cultures had encouraged a worldly outlook on both nature and themselves. Science and reason, it was argued, provided for living creatures both materially and emotionally. To see Kydor-5 and its inhabitants become so estranged from these principles perturbed the other planets deeply. And so, there was war. A secular crusade was waged between the Kydor planets and the planet once known as Kydor-5, now newly christened as Virtue. The ichor inhabitants of Virtue, however, refused to engage in open conflict, choosing instead to resist peacefully through desperate diplomacy and non-violent resistance. To call the conflict a war is perhaps disingenuous, as it quickly devolved into callous genocide. If not for the fortuitous arrival of the Ark, the ichor of Virtue would surely have been delivered into extinction.</p>
      
               <p>Aboard the Ark, the Ichor's beliefs and convictions evolved rapidly as they encountered a bevy of alien species, some of whom practiced strange mysticisms and held even stranger superstitions. By the time the Ark arrived in Kassatím, the Ichor had refined a deeply pluralistic approach to spirituality and transcendental faith. Predictably, they relished the fact that the inhabitants of Kassatím were universally religious. In equal measure, they lamented the gradual erosion of human faith in the subsequent centuries. Now, the Ichor in Qeret strive to keep the people's faith alive by maintaining the Grand Temple of Nasiru and reviving the public's reverence for the Adonian pantheon.</p>

            <h3>Impireesh Marble</h3>
        
            <p>The Impireesh Marbles are a microscopic race of Ark aliens whose population is divided among, and stored within, one dozen colorful, glass-like beads. The Marbles claim that each bead contains an egalitarian mega-city within its confines. Though each Marble purports to house millions of inhabitants, only a single voice emanates from any given bead — a self-proclaimed representative of its denizens. While the Marbles proudly consider themselves natural leaders, they eschew direct governance, instead serving as counselors and advisors to the myriad rulers of Kassatím.</p>

            <p>Like all the Ark's inhabitants, the Marbles assimilated during the Long Century of Integration. By concord, they agreed to settle in different cities across Kassatím and to refrain from interfering in the affairs of their fellow Marbles. The ten cities housing a Marble include each capital of the Great Kingdoms — Lux, Scintevah, Taur, Netush, Makar, and Drycenaea — in addition to the cities of Qeret, Lusawat, Atinae, and Ybaala. It should be noted that the exact whereabouts of the remaining two Impireesh Marbles are unknown.<sup><a href="#footnote6" id="back-to-text6">6</a></sup></p>

            <p>The Impireesh Marbles are infamous for their draconian approaches to maintaining order in their respective cities. They often counsel kings and queens to rule through fear rather than magnanimity. Curfews, purges, oppressive taxes, and summary executions frequently plague cities under the significant sway of a Marble. Conspiracies abound regarding the Marbles. Some claim that the interiors of the Impireesh Marbles are far from the utopian paradises they would have you believe. Instead, they are alleged to be hellish slave-states ruled by a single tyrannical monarch — a monarch who would have Kassatím mirror the twisted world within the Marble. Others suggest the Impireesh Marbles are not sentient beings at all but rather programmed intelligences whose directives have run afoul.Each of the Marbles, of course, ignores such plebian calumnies and insist they only wish to steward humanity towards a prosperous future.</p>

            <h4 class="centered-heading">Naming Conventions</h4>
                
            <p>Confusingly, though there are twelve Impireesh Marbles, in local contexts all are referred to as “the Impireesh Marble,” or simply, “the Marble.” In other words, a Qereti citizen refers to the Marble within Qeret as “the Impireesh Marble.” The same applies to a citizen of Lux when referring to the Marble within their city. It is only when referring to a Marble outside one's native city that the naming scheme changes. For instance, a Qereti citizen would refer to the Marble in Lux as “The Luxian Marble,” and a Luxian citizen would refer to the Marble in Qeret as “The Qereti Marble.” This second scheme also applies on the rare occasions that multiple Marbles are present in the same city, such as during diplomatic summits.</p>

               <p>These minuscule creatures once resided not in the glass beads they are now recognized for, but in the superfluid mantle of a neutron star known as <b>Galthax</b>. These creatures — then called Galthaxians — swam freely in the predictable yet turbulent neutron-fluids of their star. Over millions of local years, they established a highly sophisticated and technologically advanced society, constructing vast edifices — say, the size of a human thumb — and creating high-speed transportation pods that navigated the surface of Galthax by flitting through the interstitial currents of the star's superfluid convection cells. The Galthaxians sealed their fate when they began harnessing the immense heat of Galthax, inadvertently cooling their native star and hastening its demise.</p>

               <p>To avoid extinction, the Galthaxians constructed twelve colossal polycarbonate starships, each the size and shape of a standard marble, into which they transferred the populations of their twelve largest cities. For a time, the Galthaxians tirelessly wandered the galaxy in search of a new home. They soon discovered, however, that they had underestimated the vastness of the galaxy and that their rate of traversal was far too slow (their tiny propulsion systems being as limited as they were). They estimated, to their collective dismay, it would take approximately two trillion years to find another habitable neutron star or planet they might call home. Like many before them, and many after, they found salvation in the Ark, which intercepted them in deep space and granted them entry into its vast interior. It was during the eons spent aboard the Ark that the Galthaxians earned a new moniker: ‘the Impireesh Marbles,' a title whose meaning and linguistic origin have been lost to time.<sup><a href="#footnote7" id="back-to-text7">7</a></sup></p>

            <h3>Kemptoran</h3>
        
            <p>Kemptorans are a bipedal, flightless avian species. Silver feathers cover their entire body except for their hands and feet. Large, vestigial, retractable wings extend from their backs, capable of stretching up to five feet in either direction. Below the kemptoran's wholly gray, teardrop-shaped eyes, a wide, two-foot beak extends below their chest. Though known for their calm demeanor, the kemptoran visage is known to terrify those unaccustomed to their presence. Incredibly dexterous creatures, with twelve extendable, many-jointed fingers, they can hold a book whilst writing in it, using only a single feathered hand. When introducing themselves — or when threatened — kemptorans will extend their impressive wings and beat them several times, blowing kashenti off nearby persons and fluttering stray papers in the process.</p>

            <p>The kemptorans are a proud and highly civil species that cherish language, diplomacy, and propriety above all. More than any other Ark alien, the kemptorans have embraced human culture, believing that humans possess the potential to form highly sophisticated and well-run societies. The kemptorans envision themselves the guiding hands that will ensure humans meet this potential. To that end, kemptorans, most commonly serve as bureaucrats, silently but efficiently bringing much needed order to human society. And much like the Impireesh Marbles, they often serve as counselors to kings, queens, and emperors. Others act as diplomatic envoys, striving to foster peace among the historically competitive and combative great kingdoms of Kassatím. It is not unknown for such kemptorans to double as spies, pursuing hidden (though no doubt honorable) agendas. In Qeret, as in the rest of Kassatím, kemptorans thrive. They tend to move in elite circles, hobnobbing with dignitaries, literary celebrities, and royals. The wealthiest of them reside in <b>Dagon's Respite</b>, while the more modestly monied in <b>Tekron's Custom</b>.</p>

                Notably, the prodigians occupy a liminal space between Ark alien and Ark fauna. While their towering android forms suggest a complexity beyond most animals, their lack of any discernible sapience leaves them classified, for now, as Ark fauna. It is hypothesized that they may communicate through subtle physical gestures or an unknown form of sign language, though all attempts to establish meaningful dialogue with them have proven fruitless. As a result, most perceive the prodigians as merely oversized animals.<a href="#back-to-text1">↩</a>

                The sordid origin of the acumine remains a closely guarded secret, unknown to most outsiders. While often disliked and even disdained, most individuals who work alongside the acumine are oblivious to their true nature. Perhaps if they weren't, they wouldn't prove so trusting.<a href="#back-to-text2">↩</a>

                Many of the anarchic movements scattered across Kassatím, such as the Unfettered in Qeret, have come to revere the asectish as bearers of an exalted philosophy that the wider world might emulate. The asectish, predictably, disregard such conceits and any overtures made, viewing all ideology, regardless of form, as a tainted practice prone to corruption.<a href="#back-to-text3">↩</a>

                Though many cordepedes may labor alongside slaves, it is important to note that the enslavement of Ark aliens is strictly prohibited in most cities of Kassatím, including Qeret. This policy has been widely adopted since the <b>Long Century of Integration</b>, when most humans were eager to accommodate the aliens (and their technological marvels) rather than drive them away.<a href="#back-to-text4">↩</a>

                Researchers of ichor biology assert that the bubbles are an evolutionary byproduct of their hyper-efficient metabolism. As the ichor generate energy, carbon dioxide accumulates as a byproduct. To prevent toxic buildup, the gas is expelled through specialized pores in their skin, forming visible bubbles as it diffuses into the surrounding environment.<a href="#back-to-text5">↩</a>

                The last two Marbles were outliers among their kind. Both rejected the customs of their peers, choosing instead to lead diplomatic missions to the countless nomadic tribes that skirt the borders of Kassatím. Known simply as "Red" and "Green," these Marbles were last seen entering the Akroz Mountains on the eastern edge of the Twin Rivers, intent on opening communications with the furtive tribes of the region. Over seventy years have passed, and no word has yet descended from the Akroz of what befell the Marbles and their entourage.<a href="#back-to-text6">↩</a>

                This account of the Marble's origin is what one might call the "official narrative." It is the tale most Marbles will relate if pressed. However, over the centuries, many have noted conflicting details when comparing each Marble's story. Sometimes they hail from a neutron star, other times a black hole. Sometimes they are "Galthaxian," at others "Quistirids." Those inclined to suspicion might doubt the story's veracity entirely.<a href="#back-to-text7">↩</a>
