        <p>The arrival of the <strong>Ark</strong> ignited profound political transformations across <strong>Kassatím</strong>. Before its arrival, human societies largely adhered to long-standing social structures rooted in tradition. Concepts like social stratification, taxation, slavery, tributes, and war were as perceived natural and immutable; political beliefs, beyond religious notions of divine social order, were scarce. The advent of the Ark, however, ushered in a centuries-long reckoning. For the first time, humanity began a sustained critical assessment of its dominant modes of governance and control. This upheaval gave rise to varied responses across Kassatím. While divine right remains a legitimate basis for rule in kingdoms such as <strong>Combassyia</strong>, new systems of governance have emerged elsewhere.</p>
      
        <p>In the Great Kingdom of <strong>Léu</strong>, a digital direct democracy has replaced the divinely appointed <strong>Nesurai</strong>, enabling citizens to participate directly in their nation’s future. <strong>Netusha</strong>, once ruled by militaristic tyrants, now answers to a pious and pacifistic Ark alien king, whose influence has fundamentally altered the kingdom's conduct in matters of war and peace. <strong>Knakros</strong> has embraced a science-driven holacracy, decentralizing power in favor of expertise and collective decision-making. And within Qeret, too, radical ideologies have sprung that challenge the established social order. These movements threaten to unravel the city’s hierarchies in a historic cascade that could abolish slavery, depose the king, and sever the yoke of Combassyian rule.</p>

        <h2>Izabel's Rapture</h2>
        <p>Within the wretched streets of the <strong>Slave Sector</strong> resides a young freedwoman known only as <strong>Izabel</strong>. Each evening, after the day’s drudgery, Izabel speaks to all who will listen. She envisions a future where slavery is eradicated, and war is pruned from human experience. Though no longer owned by any master, Izabel still bears the <strong>Ark works</strong> that once marked her servitude. Serene yet charismatic, she draws to her cause the bonded and freed alike. This burgeoning movement, dubbed Izabel’s Rapture, is the fastest-growing political force in Qeret, drawing the attention of many far beyond the Slave Sector, including some of the city's wealthiest denizens.</p>

        <p>Unsurprisingly, this movement terrifies the slavers of Qeret, whose wealth and comfort depend on the steady trafficking of human chattel. In an effort to extinguish this incendiary cause, they have imposed strict curfews and meted out violent punishments to those caught consorting with the Rapture. Some have even offered Izabel great sums of silver to abandon her mission; she refuses such overtures graciously and with elegance. As her influence swells, gossip of Izabel’s Rapture fills the streets. It is rumored that the matter has reached the ears of <strong>King Tiraal</strong> himself, who wishes to resolve the matter decisively — one way or another. Izabel has established herself in a spacious villa within the Slave Sector, funded entirely through donation. Known as Izabel’s Haven, this sanctuary hosts her nightly lectures and offers refuge to all — bonded or otherwise — who seek solace and guidance.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="back-to-text1">1</a></sup></p>

            Izabel’s liberatory ideology naturally coincides with the interests of the Unfettered and it is rumored she too is a member of that elusive group. For more information regarding either, see Chapter 14: Factions.<a href="#back-to-text1">↩</a>
