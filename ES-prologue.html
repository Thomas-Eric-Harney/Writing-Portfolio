            <h2>Chris Mayhew, 1964-1999</h2>
            <p>Chris Mayhew, a talented architect and resident of Montpelier, passed away unexpectedly at his home on June 21, 1999. As a child, Chris showed an early passion for construction when he began constructing with Legos before he could even speak. This enthusiasm continued into his adolescence, when he began drawing the floor plans of the homes in his neighborhood. As an adult, he earned his degree in architecture from the University of Vermont in 1986. Following graduation, Chris became a well-respected architect in both Vermont and New Hampshire. He is now recognized for his elegant design of municipal buildings throughout Vermont.</p>

            <p>Chris is remembered for his giving nature. He spent many weekends volunteering with the Kids And Numbers charity in Montpelier, and dedicated time every Christmas to volunteer at a local soup kitchen. Chris is survived by his father, Alexander, and his two sisters, Isabel Ford and Jenny Winstead-Mayhew.</p>
