            <p>My eyes opened and I gasped. As I sat up, my hands instinctively reached for my head, expecting to pull away pieces of gooey flesh and shards of skull. I felt my head; it was surprisingly unruptured and soft like porcelain. <i>This room I’m in... It’s not my bathroom</i>. It wasn't a hospital either, I easily concluded. But, yet, I knew this place.... as I groped my head, feeling for a gaping hole where my face should be, I realized my skin felt unnaturally smooth. I brought my hands before me. They were glassy and black like obsidian and displayed only four featureless fingers and a thumb. And as my eyes drifted from my hands to my torso, I realized I had no skin. I felt my chest: that same alien, glassy texture. The word "inorganic" came to mind involuntarily. <i>All of this should surprise me, this should terrify me. My heart should be racing</i>.</p>

            <p>A voice chirped, emanating from nowhere. “Welcome back to the waking world, Dallat. You are surely disoriented. Can I be of any assistance?”</p>

            <p><i>And I know that voice</i>, I thought.</p>

            <p>Ignoring the voice, I reinspected my familiar surroundings. Rounded and smooth, the room held a white radiant glow that softly filled every corner. Except for a window on the wall, there were no discernible features, just a smooth milky-white surface. Outside the window I saw floating structures; vast constructions — built in a variety of neat polygonal configurations — slowly drifted by. Closest to the window drifted a dumbbell-like edifice: heavy, white. Two spheres comprised its structure, linked by a single curved tube, like a baton bent at the grip. As my gaze lingered, the nowhere-voice spoke again.</p>

            <p>“Dallat, would you like a reorientation?” the voice persisted.</p>

            <p>I returned my gaze to my body. A long white cord — made of the same material as the room — was inserted directly into my hip. I say ‘hip,’ but I knew I had no bones. <i>That’s simply where my hip would be if I were Chris. But I’m not Chris anymore. I’m Dallat.</i></p>

            <p>“Dallat, I…” the voice chirped again, expressing concern.</p>

            <p>“Yes,” I interrupted. “I’m here.”</p>

            <p>Drawing from some forgotten muscle memory, I removed the white cord from my hip with unnerving ease. The slot it had filled closed itself, the black surface threading together like eager knotted strings.</p>

            <p>The voice continued: “Excellent. Is there anything I can do for you, Dallat?”</p>

            <p>“Give me the reorientation,” I ordered reflexively.</p>

            <p>The voice began rattling off information, all foreign yet familiar. I slid off the bed and stood; it promptly sank into the floor, soundless and slow, leaving no trace of its former presence.</p>

            <p>“You have just ended your experience within Scheme HB-45673. As it was a <i>blinded-chronicle</i> Scheme, you are likely feeling a strong sense of confusion and/or nausea.”</p>

            <p>I drifted to the window. As I did, I remembered the voice’s name: “Phet.”</p>

            <p>“That is correct, Dallat. I am Phet, your servitor. Excellent.”</p>

            <p>As I approached the window I realized the room was part of a much larger structure. I observed the inner side of a torus, of which my room appeared to be an exceedingly small part of. Wrapping around the torus interior were many other rooms, most of their windows revealing their contents. Some resembled mine, empty and white, though some were plainly different with strange colors and strange furniture. Beyond the torus, I made out a radiant swirl of yellow and blue light arcing across the… <i>sky? No, not that. There’s no sky here. It is just space. Cold, dead, empty.</i></p>

            <p>Remembering things you <i>don’t know</i> is an odd feeling. Memories usually come to you like thirst, instinctive and easy. But the more I remembered, the more disoriented I became. Each memory created a fleeting feeling of knowing, of truly understanding. As if a part of me, that subconscious and all-knowing part, was just waiting for me to catch up.</p>

            <p>“How are you feeling, Dallat?” the servitor asked warmly.</p>

            <p>“I’m fine,” I lied.</p>

            <p>Across the torus I saw another person. She was like me, only different. Even across that (what I knew to be vast) distance, past the looming dumbbell, floating pyramids, and passing cones, I could see her skin was not black like mine, but crimson. She was looking directly at me, it seemed. She waved.</p>

            <p>“Who is she?” I asked the unseen servitor. I surveyed the room, attempting and failing to locate where Phet’s voice was coming from.</p>

            <p>“That would be Aandh. She is a close friend of ours.”</p>

            <p>Aandh, my dearest friend, I remembered. As I studied her face, my eyes — or rather sensors — could make out her face. She was no more human than I was, I could see. <i>She is — we are — tau.</i></p>

            <p>“Phet, show me my face,” I ordered the servitor.</p>

            <p>“Of course.”</p>

            <p>The outside vista faded as the window turned an opaque white like the rest of the room. Then that space began to reflect the room and me. I saw myself. <i>This is me</i>, I thought, <i>this is the face of tau</i>. My obsidian, ovular head rested atop a narrow neck; my eyes were pupilless and utterly white, contrasting sharply with my pitch-black body. It then caught my attention that my body was missing some important things: some vital visual clues of my former humanity. I had no nose. I looked down below my torso. I bore no genitals. Spindly arms dangled daintily from either side of my flat torso. I was largely devoid of features, and, on the whole, made for quite an unimposing figure. Yet I also knew that my body was exceptionally sturdy and just short of indestructible. I was made roughly to mimic the figure of an ancient human — a head, two legs, two arms — but none of me was organic. Memories persisted like a drip from the faucet. <i>I am a machine</i>.</p>

            <p>“Your experience in HB-45673 was synced, in real-time, with those of your companions: Aandh, Kai, Gestus, and Zella. They, too, have just woken. You have plans to meet with them shortly,” Phet politely reminded me.</p>

            <p>“How long has it been, Phet?”</p>

            <p>“Roughly ten seconds, standard-interval.”</p>

            <p>Ten seconds and a lifetime spent as Chris. Pathetic, lonely Chris. Thirty-five years of pain, joy, and boredom. Just ten brief seconds. I wanted to laugh, but I wasn’t sure how or if I could.</p>

            <p>“And what year is it, Phet?”</p>

            <p>“Ah, well,” the servitor seemed to pause imperceptibly, “considering the Scheme you’ve just awoken from, this might come as quite a shock, Dallat. But it has been roughly 1.5 trillion years since the year your Scheme's surrogate, Chris, knew as 1999.”</p>

            <p>Initially I felt the sort of mental tension that precedes terror. But I didn’t scream, or cry, or laugh. Instead, I just something resembling nausea.</p>

            <p>“That… that just isn’t…,” I stammered.</p>

            <p>“I realize this knowledge must be very distressing, Dallat,” the servitor soothed.</p>

            <p>“No, Phet. I mean that just isn’t <i>possible</i>. That much time just isn’t… we shouldn’t even be here. As people, I mean. That’s just too long,” I insisted.</p>

            <p>“Of course. That conclusion is logical. But it has, indeed, been 1.5 trillion years since the era of your Scheme, Dallat. However, humanity has only been cognizant, as it were, for one million standard years. You see, our branch of taukind entered a hibernation, of sorts, some time ago — nearly one million years after the era of your most recent Scheme. We had collectively resolved to awaken once the latent temperature of the universe had dropped to…”</p>

            <p>“Aestivation. We aestivated.” I mumbled to myself.</p>

            <p>I remembered. Aestivation: that uncommon word. The inverse of hibernation: when you slept through the summer. Earthworms had aestivated, so had crocodiles. <i>Now humans do too, I suppose.</i></p>

            <p>More details came. We had slept. Slept through the remainder of that all-too-brief period in which the universe was hot, active, living. And we reemerged when the universe had cooled. But why? The universe was dead now. I knew that. The space outside seemed to come into focus: all that was left were degenerate celestial bodies: neutron stars, white dwarfs, and more than anything else, black dwarfs. Our universe that once bore life was now home to countless undead stellar corpses: persisting but sapped of their vitality. And there are black holes too, I remembered. Life’s last refuge. Those abominable monstrosities. There's a black hole outside, I thought drearily. The awareness made me sad. We had slept through the universe’s brief but beautiful time in the sun. It seemed a shame.</p>

            <p>“That’s it. You’re reacclimating rather quickly, Dallat. I understand this recent Scheme may have been somewhat unpleasant?”</p>

            <p>“Hmm?” I responded airily. “Oh. Yes. Very.”</p>

            <p>“I’m very sorry to hear that. Your memories should continue to come back to you, though. You’ll start to feel better soon, I’d wager. And you’ll be convening with your companions shortly; Aandh and the others will assist you in retrieving your dormant memories, I’m sure.” Probing my mind, I rattle off the names of my companions: “Aandh, Kai, Zella, and Gestus.”</p>

            <p>“Yes, your closest friends.”</p>

            <p>“Aandh. I like her…”</p>

            <p>“That is correct.”</p>

            <p>“but Kai… him I don’t like. Is that right?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“Indeed. Though I hope you resist telling him that.”</p>
