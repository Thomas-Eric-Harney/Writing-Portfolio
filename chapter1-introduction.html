            <h2>Kassatím & Qeret</h2>
            <p>The word <i><b><a href="qereti-codex.html#kassatim-entry">Kassatím</a></b></i> signifies the universe. Once believed to encompass all that existed and all that could ever exist, this "universe," as it was once understood, stretches from the southern arid deserts of the continent of <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#leu-entry">Léu</a></b>, north to the innumerable isles of <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#knakros-entry">Knakros</a></b> and <B><a href="qereti-codex.html#drys-entry">Drys</a></B> on the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#cerulean-entry">Cerulean Sea</a></b>, east across the rugged hills and forests of <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#netusha-entry">Netusha</a></b>, and south to the mighty citadels of <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#combassyia-entry">Combassyia</a></b> and fertile alluvial plains of <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#makaria-entry">Makaria</a></b>. In these lands far future and distant past collide. Once, in centuries past, Kassatím had been a humble human civilization that waged war with bronze and whose crowning technological achievement had been the plow. In that time agricultural production and military might determined the survival and prosperity of any society. Few lived in luxury, with most subsisting on diets of basic cereals while dedicating their days to tending fields of barley or practicing simple artisanal trades. This changed, however, with the arrival of <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#ark-entry">the Ark</a></b>: a mountain-sized interstellar spacecraft carrying millions of extraterrestrial refugees. The many alien cultures aboard the Ark, each displaced by cataclysm, perceived Earth a paradise they might finally call home. Principally, these Ark aliens came in peace, for after many cycles spent aboard the Ark — indeed eons for some — they eagerly sought sanctuary.</p>

            <p>Three centuries later, the alien inhabitants of the Ark have dispersed across the world of Kassatím in tow with their advanced technologies. Deadly <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#particlehammer-entry">particle hammers</a></i>, <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#antihydrogenplant-entry">antihydrogen power plants</a></i>, and robotic <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#servitor-entry">servitors</a></i>, among many other innovations, have become commonplace within the once primitive world of Kassatím. Owing to the introduction of <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#antisenescence-entry">antisenescence</a></i> treatments, the lifespan of the average human has expanded dramatically, transforming a short existence measured in decades into one stretching over centuries. <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#fertilizerpod-entry">Fertilizer pods</a></i> now enrich fields of barley in a matter of hours, forever eliminating the threat of starvation and famine. While once most humans subsisted to survive, they now choose their calling as the division of labor continues to diversify and new occupations arise. Many celebrate this new golden age and insist Kassatím has become a cosmopolitan bastion of progress and technological advancement. Others warn of the potential consequences of such unbridled innovation.</p>

            <p>Perhaps most exceptional of all the great cities of the world is the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#adoniah-entry">Adonian</a></b> city-state of Qeret: an island nation located on the Cerulean Sea, off the coast of the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#twinrivers-entry">Twin Rivers</a></b>, and regional locus of trade, culture, and scientific ingenuity. Qeret lies at a juncture between the thriving eastern nations of Makaria, Netusha, and Combassyia and the western kingdoms of the Cerulean. Accordingly, much global commerce moves through its confines, attracting many tourists and permanent inhabitants alike. In Qeret, Ark aliens and humans live alongside one another, each influencing the other. And Ark Alien technology, too, has become a familiar part of everyday life. Humans and aliens wear translating <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#prompter-entry">prompters</a></i> in their ears; scholars and scientists study and correspond with <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#arktablet-entry">Ark tablets</a></i> in hand; and musicians play harps in the streets as they accompany <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#lantern-entry">lanterns</a></i> that project hololoops for passersby. In this way, Qeret reflects a unique blend of cultures whose citizenry includes members of the major cultures of Kassatím, and indeed, the galaxy.</p>

            <p>The setting of Qeret is rich in lore and offers players a wealth of opportunities for action, intrigue, exploration, and narrative conflict. As players explore Qeret, they will find that a nascent arms race now pits the Great Kingdoms against each other as each develops and hoards devastatingly advanced weapons of war. Revolution seethes as Ark Alien ideologies radicalize the lower classes and the people begin to question age-old institutions and customs. Worse, some few Ark aliens seek not to peacefully coexist with humans, but to conquer them. Players will also encounter many different characters and factions: spies and unscrupulous diplomats gossip and plot in the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#qereticourt-entry">Qereti Court</a></b> while Ark alien scientists conduct ethically dubious experiments in the halls of the esteemed <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#theinstitute-entry">Institute</a></b>. Insurgent groups such as the anarchic <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#theunfettered-entry">Unfettered</a></b> plot in unlikely places, and deadly secrets wait behind every corner. Qeret, and the wider world of Kassatím, stands at a crossroads and the fate of the city lies in the hands of the players.</p>

            <h2>What is <i>Qeret</i>?</h2>
            <p><i>Qeret: A City Module</i> is a system-agnostic setting for tabletop roleplaying games, meaning this game may be played with any system preferred by the GM and their players. Generalized systems such as Chaosium’s <i>Basic-Roleplaying</i> or Design Mechanism’s <i>Mythras</i> are well suited for the setting of <i>Qeret</i>, as their wide range of skills and innate modularity allow for immersive genre-bending campaigns. Alternatively, players may even use minimalist iterations of their favorite fantasy roleplaying game, such as Ben Milton’s <i>Knave</i>. In these instances, however, players are best advised to tinker with their chosen system so that it works thematically with the setting; one might need to swap demihumans with Ark aliens, and exchange spells for technology and Ark-Works, etc.</p>

            <p>The formal parameter of this module is the city of Qeret and its environs. Though an explicit world-setting accompanies Qeret, the primary contents of this book concern this single city. Though Qeret will not supply rules of play, it does provide lore, factions, locations, alien species, adventure hooks, encounters, and a sprawling dungeon. In terms of play style, Qeret lends itself to campaigns of intrigue, adventure, exploration, or any mixture of the three. Most factions and NPCs will embroil players in plots and schemes, while the city itself and its surrounding area provides plenty of material for players wishing to dungeon crawl, engage in combat, and uncover the secrets of the city.</p>

            <h2>Running <i>Qeret</i></h2>
            <p>Qeret supports sandbox campaigns in which players decide where they go, what they do, and how they do it. During sandbox play the GM supplies little, if any, direction to the players. That said, the adventure <b>"A Cat May Look at a King"</b> serves as an excellent introduction to the setting. In this adventure players will become familiar with the nine sectors of the city, the Qereti Court, the Unfettered, and major NPCs such as the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#impireeshmarble-entry">Impireesh Marble</a></b> and <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#kingtiraal-entry">King Tiraal</a></b>. During the course of the adventure players will become equipped with an intimate knowledge of the city and its general structure.</p>

            <p>Qeret is a lore-heavy module. But the surest way to preserve your sanity (and that of your players) is to only use lore when needed. To be sure, the GM may read as much of the module as they wish before diving into a campaign. But this isn’t required! Start with what interests you most, and if you can, ascertain what kind of game your players want. If they lean towards action-packed adventures or espionage-thrillers, then reading up on some relevant factions — such as the <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#qereticompany-entry">Qereti Company</a></b> and the Qereti Court — will come in handy. If your players want to play as revolutionaries, philosophers, or even as Ark aliens, then the GM should examine the <b>Revolution</b>, <b>Philosophy</b>, and <b>Ark aliens</b> sections, respectively. Once you’ve gleaned as much lore as you’re comfortable with, peruse the <b>Locations</b> section of the module and pick a location to begin play. The Locations section is the GM’s best friend: overflowing with NPCs, secret areas, quest seeds, encounters, and more, Locations should be the go-to reference for GMs during play.</p>

            <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
            <h3>Science & Technology</h3>
            <p>With the arrival of the Ark aliens came a deluge of advanced sciences and their derived technologies. Before the Ark, some three hundred years ago, the agricultural revolution and its resultant innovations were among humanity’s greatest achievements. The channeling of water into intricate irrigation systems enabled humans to grow crops in abundance and machines such as plows and threshers enabled agrarians to efficiently reap their bountiful fields. And with time other advancements followed. The Makarians practiced crude astronomy in their primordial temples. In the tan plains of Netusha, blacksmiths discovered the art of forging bronze from copper and tin while the indomitable Léusian peoples crafted the first war chariots. But though these achievements seemed great, they could not compare to the machines and sciences the Ark aliens would soon introduce to society.</p>

            <p>The Ark carried a disparate assortment of alien species, the majority of which came from highly advanced societies whose collective knowledge far eclipsed that of humanity. And as the Ark aliens integrated into human society, so too did their scientific insights and technologies. In a matter of decades, every major city had become powered by anti-hydrogen power plants. Kings could now communicate with each other across vast distances using <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#relay-entry">relays</a></i> that linked via entangled particles. Alien geneticists introduced anti-senescence treatments that could retard the aging process. Even agriculture, that science so crucial to the history of mankind, was revolutionized once again. Famine and drought became vestiges of a seemingly distant past, as fertilizer pods could be planted in a fallow field to quickly fertilize acres upon acres of farmland, forever ending any threat of starvation or want.</p>

            <p>In short, the ancient world of Kassatím became materially fused with the advancements of the Ark aliens. Players will interact with a world in which a mercenary is just as likely to fight with a bronze sword as they are with an ax coated in corrosive <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#dust-entry">Dust</a></i> gel. Though they may see ancient limestone abodes in some parts of the city, they will also find grand marble villas decorated with glistering electronic <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#skein-entry">skeins</a></i>. But Qeret is not solely a game about the wonders of invention, but of its consequences as well. Just as the human-conceived war chariots, in their time, elevated the cost of war — whether by resources, lives, or societal strain — the introduction of Ark-derived weapons into human society threatens to destabilize the known world as countries race to hoard those calamitous machines.</p>
            
            <h3>Philosophy & Revolution</h3>
            <p>In addition to advanced technologies, Ark aliens introduced exotic customs and beliefs to humanity. Before the Ark there was no distinction between the abstract and the material. God-kings and high priests ruled absolutely and unaccountably, their authority reinforced by notions of divine right. By this holy mandate, rulers funded their ancient regimes through demanding tribute systems, and when great kingdoms declared war, it was at the behest of the gods. A rigid social hierarchy existed in Kassatím as it did in heaven: just as the farmer was inferior to the soldier, so too was a god of the plow to a god of war. Over millennia these enduring principles reinforced immemorial power structures and established social orders built on submission. As a result, the existence of gods went long unquestioned and societal conditions went long unaltered.</p>

            <p>Each species of the Ark, however, emerged from cultural environments vastly different from humanity’s. Some such as the highly civilized <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#kemptoran-entry">kemptorans</a></i> thrived by using complex regulatory systems — systems that eclipsed even the most byzantine of human bureaucracies. Others, such as the <i><a href="qereti-codex.html#asectish-entry">asectish</a></i>, spent eons ruling as tyrants in their home system; now rueful of their past actions, they have embraced a culture of non-aggression and pastoralism. More recently, aboard the Ark, many species came together to form the movement known as <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#theweave-entry">the Weave</a></b>: a philosophy that seeks to reconcile the psychological and cultural differences of all sentient beings. As one can imagine, the meeting of Ark alien and human cultures disrupted much of the customs humanity took for granted.</p>

            <p>For instance, the Ark alien culture left an indelible mark on the religious beliefs of humankind. Following the Ark’s arrival, it quickly became apparent that most of its denizens were utterly devoid of religious sentiments. Humans had long known that peoples of different lands often worshipped different gods, but the concept of godless people disturbed many humans. Other Ark aliens revealed that their parent cultures had no concept of governance or its rules of law. Religion and government — formerly the two basic components of power on Earth — were put under greater scrutiny as humans began to mingle with Ark aliens and familiarize themselves with each other. Now cities such as Qeret have become increasingly secularized, and radical political movements have begun to sprout among the people. In Qeret, players may choose to foment dissent and bring a new age inspired by the myriad cultures of the Ark. Or they may seek to preserve humanity’s customs and attempt to improve human society on its own terms.</p>
            
            <h3>War & Diplomacy</h3>
            <p>Qeret is but one city among hundreds. Not only is it part of a wide, geographically disparate network of city-states known collectively as Adoniah, but there are numerous other cultures and great kingdoms that populate the wider world of Kassatím. To the west of the Qereti isle, on another continent, is the Great Kingdom of Léu: a prosperous, yet directionless, technological paradise. To the northeast of Qeret, upon the mainland, is the Great Kingdom of Combassyia, to which Qeret is a vassal. This seigneury is a militaristic autocracy ruled by its despotic emperor <b><a href="qereti-codex.html#banipahlbyzes-entry">Banipahl Byzes</a></b>, who demands stiff tribute from the Qereti King and his people. Across the Cerulean Sea rests the upstart Great Kingdom of Drys, populated by warlords and sophists, it now slowly endeavors to reform its ancient piratical ways. The relationships that nations share in Kassatím are complex, and perhaps most so in Qeret, where trade exerts influence over every other aspect of life: not only must the Qereti monarchy work to placate Combassyia, but they must also maintain healthy ties with the other great kingdoms and Adonian city-states to ensure stable profits.</p>
        
            <p>Though there are no major wars at present, make no mistake, the threat still looms. Many diplomats from each great kingdom and from the other Adonian city-states work to ameliorate and cool tensions. At first glance, Qereti politics may seem innocuous, but in truth, the Qereti Court is a hub of intrigue and duplicity. Some diplomats outwardly seek peace and cooperation, but in truth work as spies, either for their native culture or as double agents in service to a rival nation. Some established members of the court are Combassyian representatives of Banipahl Byzes; ostensibly these emissaries represent the interests of their overlord, but in truth seek to surreptitiously influence Qereti affairs. While most members of the Court have sworn allegiance to Qeret’s monarch, King Tiraal, rumors persist that secret agents of the radical Unfettered have infiltrated the very highest stations in the Palace, a claim whispered by courtiers and intelligence operatives alike. Representing the king’s iron hand in Court is the Ark alien Impireesh Marble: a literal marble that is said to house a microscopic city within its diminutive confines. The Marble employs thousands of spies and often performs draconian purges of those suspected of treason.</p>

            <p>Should players choose to engage in campaigns of intrigue or diplomacy they may pick an ideological perspective or a culture to champion. Alternatively, they may be motivated merely by profit; spy work and the sale of intelligence can be extremely lucrative endeavors. But the dance of diplomacy is a dangerous one; escalating tensions between great kingdoms often leads to war, and toppling governments often invites societal chaos. Regardless of their choices, players engaged in games of intrigue will find that change often comes at great price, and solutions often beget problems.</p>
