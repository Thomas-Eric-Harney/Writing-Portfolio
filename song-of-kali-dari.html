        <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Across this wide panel are eight cuneiform symbols (in a 4x2 formation) with their English translation underneath each. From left to right: godship, truth, law, art, power, the letter, wisdom, terror. There are also many symbols in the background, smaller and blurred, implying a multitude.

        <p><u>Dari</u>: Guiding the universe are the Mes: divine words that maintain harmony through all that exists. They compel every word, every marvel, and every tool.

        <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Enki. He is the lord of water and the wisest of gods. He is the keeper of all <i>Mes</i> that govern the world.

        <p><b>Panel 5</b>: The fifth god is a man with open hands that wield nothing. He is circled by phases of the moon.
