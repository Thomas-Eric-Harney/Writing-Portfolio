            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: A depiction of two white circles vertically overlapping each other on a black background. The top sphere contains stars, while the bottom contains a disk-shaped depiction of Earth. On the disk-earth are rivers, trees, and desert. The overlapping region between the two circles has a pearlescent white hue. </p>
        
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Before the age of man, Heaven and Earth were intertwined. Our mortal house shared with the house of Gods.</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Within this union slept <i>Lil</i>: the breath and spirit of the universe.
  
            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: The circles separate. The white now swirls through and around the two circles.
        
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Once awoken, however, Lil expanded and forever separated Heaven and Earth.
  
            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The earth-circle now contains settlements dotting the landscape with a towering city brown city at its center. A reddish-brown Ziggurat can be made out at its center.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: It was at this time that man and animal began to seed this Earthly realm.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Across this wide panel are eight cuneiform symbols (in a 4x2 formation) with their English translation underneath each. From left to right: godship, truth, law, art, power, the letter, wisdom, terror. There are also many symbols in the background, smaller and blurred, implying a multitude.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Guiding the universe are the Mes: divine words that maintain harmony through all that exists. They compel every word, every marvel, and every tool.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: A depiction of seven anthropomorphic gods standing side by side. Descriptions provided below.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Among the many Gods of Heaven are seven who reign.

        <h2>Page 2</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: The first god. He has a long, curled, and oiled beard. He wields two scepters and has four wings along his back.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: There is An, the genitor of all Gods and King of Heaven.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: The second god. He wields two daggers. He is surrounded by swirling wind and lightning.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .and there is Enlil, God of wind and Lil.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The third god. A smiling man surrounded by reeds that holds a clay tablet, scriven with cuneiform, in his hand.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Enki. He is the lord of water and the wisest of gods. He is the keeper of all <i>Mes</i> that govern the world.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: The fourth god is a woman with wide hips and hair curled in a way that resembles the Omega letter. She holds a jug of milk.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Beloved by the children is Ninhursag. The first consort of An, she is the mother goddess of the universe.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: The fifth god is a man with open hands that wield nothing. He is circled by phases of the moon.
            
            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Nanna, the Lord of the Moon, and he that supervises the passage of time.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: The sixth god. He wields a sword in one hand, whip in the other. The sun shines directly above his head.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .sibling to Nanna is Utu, Lord of the Sun. He illuminates all in the universe and governs truth and law.  
        
        <h2>Page 3</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: This panel is substantially larger than the previous page’s panels. It depicts a winged goddess as she lounges in the air. Reeds and barley grow in the earth beneath her. Two lions sleep amid the reeds.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Finally, there is the Goddess Inanna: Lady of passionate love and fierce ambition. Her domain is that of fertility and human fecundity. Resplendent in her glory, she harnesses. . . Namazu quit picking your nose.

            <P><b>Panel 2</b>: We see a wide view of two dark-brown eyes that have just opened.

            <p><u>Gizzal (FOP)</u>: Good. Now throw it away. Thank you. Now where was I… Ahh look who is awake! Say hello to Kali-Dari children!

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: A man is shown sitting himself up from a prone position upon a tan mat of reeds. He is a stout man with long brown hair that is streaked with gray. He has a paunch visible underneath his ropes. He wipes the sleep from his eyes as the children greet him. 

            <p><u>Children in unison (FOP)</u>: Hello Kali-Dari!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Hello my young scribes. How are the lessons proceeding, Mah-Gizzal?

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: We now see the rest of the room. Gizzal is a younger man with hair and beard closely shaved. He holds a clay tablet in his hand and stands before a dozen children. They are seated on reedy mats upon the floor. Namazu (the nosepicker) looks to be six or seven. In the background priests and priestesses scurry about, all with clay tablets in hand. A statue of Inanna can made out in the distance. Bundles of barley are clustered in the corner. A table behind Gizzal displays stone idols of each of the gods listed previously, with the center idol of Inanna being the largest. 

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Excellently! Namazu, tell Kali-Dari about what we have learned.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Inanna is the Lady of Uruk. We give her our food and she… um…

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Very good. Shimusa, why don’t you help Namazu.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: We see the students from a different angle. Shimusa, the student speaking, appears to be around twelve years of age and has a wide smile as she speaks. The students all have clay tablets before them. Cuneiform writing is seen wedged into them. Namazu’s finger has returned to his nose.

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Fantastic, as always. Uli, tell the Kali-Dari more about our temple.

            <p>[Uli is a heavy-set boy with a thick brow and messy brown hair]

            <p><u>Uli</u>: In the name of Inanna, we of the temple then dispense the city’s bounty to the free denizens of Uruk. The Eanna temple is led by the Ensi. He is the high priest who represents the interests of the Goddess on Earth. After him is the Kali, that’s you Kali-Dari… he administers the temple and its attendants. Next, are the Nindingi and the…

            <p><u>Dari</u>: That’s enough, Uli. Thank you. It seems the lessons are coming along splendidly, Mah-Gizzal. Each of you will be priests and counters of the highest order, I am sure. 

            <p>[Dari smiles warmly]

        <h2>Page 4</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Wide view of Dari working with a tablet as he is counting bundels of Barley. He is attended by a young man in robes. In the background worshippers pass. Some priestesses are setting incense before a stone statue of Inanna.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: ...one hundred fifty three, one hundred seventy, one hundred eighty seven, two hundred two... it seems we are missing two bundels.

            <p>[He presses wedges into his tablet]

            <p><u>Young man</u>: Yes, Kali-Dari. I will let them know at once.

            <p>[The young man bows]

            <p><b>Panels 2, 3, 4, 5</b>: These small panels are arranged next to each other, across the page. In sequential order they reveal Dari’s personal cylindrical seal in his hand. It is made from crystal and has a low relief wrapped around it. The next three panels depict the seal rolling over the bottom of his tablet. The imprint to the left depicts an offering made to Inanna. Inanna is depicted amid reeds and accompanied by two lions. The high-priest, Ensi, is depicted facing towards her. Behind him, are the many people of Uruk. Behind the Ensi numerous subordinate priests stand. Each wields tools that indicate their profession. The whip for the buffalo herder, the plough for the farmer, the hoe for the gardener, the tablet for the scribe, and the net for the fisherman.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Dari stands before a crowd of people along with many female priestesses. They hand out bundels of barley to the people of Uruk. Dari calls out names.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Tilhar!.... Mesharra!.... Bilu... err...Biluqah?....

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I cannot read this one… [He whispers to a female priestess beside him.]

            <p>[The priestess looks over his shoulder at the tablet.]

            <p><u>Priestess</u>: Biluda.

            <p><b>Panel 7</b>: An view facing the crowd. A young girl emerges from the crowd and runs to Dari, she leads an even younger girl by the hand.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Biluda! <i>Thank you, priestess</i> [He whispers]

            <p><u>Young Girl (Lala)</u>: Kali-Dari!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: What is it Lala, I am busy.

        <h2>Page 5</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Lala tugs on Dari’s robes. The younger girl has her hand stretched out to Dari.

            <p><u>Lala</u>: My sister wants to see your seal, Kali-Dari. I told her that it shines like the sun.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see, and what is your sister’s name?

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Lilla.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: That is confusing.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari kneels before the two young girls. He pulls his crystal seal from a pocket in his robes.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Careful with this, Lilla.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The little girl holds the seal now. She looks at it through the sun, light from the crystal seal refracts onto her face.

            <p><u>Lilla</u>: Wooooow...

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Girls, how is your father?

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Fine. He spends more time with the buffalo than he does with mother, though.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see. Such is the nature of his calling, I suppose. I will see you all here next week, yes?

            [Dari Passes a bundel of Barley to Lala]

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Lala returns to the crowd with her sister. Dari returns the seal to his pocket.

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Of course, Kali-Dari. We cannot live on buffalo milk alone!

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: A view of the interior of the temple again. Kali-Dari prays, prostrated, before a statue of Inanna with his fellow priests and priestesses. Behind them are many of the people who have received their redistributed bundels of barley that they hold under their arms and in baskets. They pray.

        <h2>Pages 6 & 7</h2>

            <p><b>Splash</b>: A two page view of Uruk from high above. The city is expansive with the temple of Eanna sitting atop a massive Ziggurat at the center. The Ziggurat towers over the rest of the city. It is swarming with human activity and banners and painted murals decorate it much of it, top to bottom. In the distance irrigated fields of barley can be seen surrounding the city. Canals of water flow through them in grid-like patterns. The streets teem with people, goat, and buffalo.
                
        <h2>Page 8</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari leans on a half-constructed stone statue outside the temple of Eanna. He eats dates, one palm full of them, while the other throws them into his mouth. There is an older man with a chisel chipping at the statue.

            <p><u>Older Man (Kal)</u>: How’s life in the temple?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Fine, Kal. And the life of Uruk’s Master Sculptor? 
                
            <p><u>Kal</u>: Splendid! Praise Inanna, this may be my best work yet.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari looks up at the half-completed depiction, its face still an amorphous blob.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: How can you tell?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Naturally I can sense such things.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Naturally.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Kal</u>: I cannot say I am happy with the laborers the temple has provided.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari spots a man, brandishing a club, yelling at a group of laborers close to where he and Kal are standing. The laborers work on the foundation of a building.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: They seem adequate enough...

            <p><u>Kal</u>: They were borrowed from the northern settlements, but they did not come here willingly and they have little experience. Such a combination begets poor craftsmanship. And to be truthful, I regret that my works should require such hardships.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari brushes his hands against his robes after finishing the last date.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: First, they are not <i>your</i> works. They are Inanna’s.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Second, we protect these people from the mountain tribes. In return, they do work in the name of Inanna, whom they love. And, look, their work enriches our temples, allowing us to care for the people of Uruk. This is a good thing, Kal.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: I suppose.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari assesses the group of slaves again, but this time sees a young girl among their number. She hands a bowel of water to an older worker.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: A closer view of the girl’s face. She has beautiful dark eyes and a distinct birth mark that covers most of her lower jaw. She return's Dari's gaze.

            <p><u>Kal (FOP)</u>: Just look at them Dari. Wretched lot...

        <h2>Page 9</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari pries his gaze away (a look of consternation on his face) as Kal tugs his robes to get his attention. Kal gestures to the street where a large group of men are passing by.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: A wide shot of the men passing by. They are dressed in leather tunics and skirts. Most of them wield slings or large wooden clubs. Two or three at the front of the group have axes of flint, gleaming obsidian daggers, or spears with copper tips. Many of them look terrified.

            <p><u>Dari (FOP)</u>: Ahh. A lion devoured a travelling administrator, two days past. The Ensi commanded that a lot be drawn to determine the band that would track the beast and capture the beast. Once they return, the Ensi plans to slay the captured beast himself.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: A view of Dari and Kal as the last of the amateur lion trackers pass by.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Potters and weavers going lion hunting… Inanna protect them. 

            <p>[Kal shakes his head.]</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: They are led by Uruk’s greatest hunters, Kal. Besides, they won’t be killing it, just tracking it.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: And capturing it... they look petrified, Dari. They aren’t meant for that sort of work.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: <i>Everybody</i> in Uruk is subject to be drawn in a lot, Kal. Regardless of station.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: A silent panel as Kal considers this and continues to chip away at his statue.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari turns and starts to walk away.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: <i>Everybody...?</i>

            <p>[Dari throws his head down in exasperation.]</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: We are too important to the temple and to the Ensi, Kal. Although I do not know why he values you so, old man. You are feeble-minded and your statues are horrendous.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Haha! That’s the Goddess you’ve just insulted, Dari!

        <h2>Page 10</h2>
                
            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: A view of Uruk at night. The moon hangs full in the sky. It is deep orange and shines on the city below. Torches wrap around tiers of the Ziggurat, though the rest of the city is largely dark.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: We return to the temple interior. Dari points as he instructs temple attendants while they carry things up the stairs of the temple.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: An angle of the street leading away from the temple. Up the street, a small girl watches Dari and the workers.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari stops what he is doing, perhaps sensing the girl's gaze. He looks at the girl.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: It is the northern girl that he saw earlier in the day, the one with the birthmark on her chin. The moon’s orange light illuminates her face. Her dark eyes reflect the light.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: She turns away and darts into a nearby alley.

            <p><b>Panel 7</b>: Close-up of Dari’s face. He looks perplexed. There is something about this girl.

        <h2>Page 11</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari trots down the street toward the alley she disappeared into.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: A view from behind Dari as he pokes his head into the alley. He sees her turn a corner into another alley.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari emerges into a lit courtyard. There are a dozen men and women drinking and laughing around a fountain. He is already breathing heavily, slouching from fatigue.  

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari gingerly steps around the revelers and spots something ahead.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: From Dari’s perspective, we see the girl, just barely, as she disappears down yet another alleyway.

        <h2>Page 12</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari peers down the alley the girl has just turned down. It has an almost comically steep incline ascending almost as if toward to the orange moon that hangs above.

            <p>[A word balloon with a question mark hovers over Dari’s head.]</p>

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari looks back before he ascends. The revelers he had passed are now gone. No trace of them remains.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari scrambles up the steep alleyway. The sky above him has taken on an unnatural, pink-purple hue.
                
            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari continues climbing. The alley is somehow even steeper. The houses surrounding him are now slightly lop-sided. Odd, non-cuneiformic symbols are painted on the walls. Purple light bathes the area around him.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari reaches the top of the incline and then emerges from the alley. He is now bathed in a brilliant, shimmering blue light. He squints towards its source.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Same angle as above. Dark drops to his knees. 

        <h2>Page 13</h2>

            <p><b>Full Page</b>: We see what Dari sees: an open courtyard with a Goddess at its center. This Goddess is unlike Inanna or any of the other gods referenced earlier. She walks elegantly out of a yawning, teardrop-shaped rupture in the scenery. Her exceptionally long hair floats in the air as if she were submerged in water, reaching out like tendrils towards the northern girl. The goddess has a dark complexion and eyes like prisms. The spatial maw from which she emerges reveals glimpses of floating amorphous blobs of light. Impossibly, there is no longer a moon in the sky but two planets. The larger one is dark red while the other is black. The buildings surrounding the courtyard seem to be leaning towards the Goddess, seemingly ready to buckle and collapse. The Goddess augustly extends a hand to the young girl. The young girl is on her knees, praying.

        <h2>Page 14</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: A close-up of Dari. Tears stream down his face as he stares in awe. A wash of colors bathe his face. (Think Dave in the climax of <i>2001.</i>)

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari faints.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: All black.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari awakes suddenly. A stick prods his face.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: We see it is the child Namazu (the nosepicker) who wields the stick.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Kali-Dari...?

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Dari is on his feet, spinning. The courtyard he is in appears completely normal. A crowd has gathered and watches him, amused.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Kali-Dari...? Are you ok?

        <h2>Page 15</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Through passing crowds we see Dari talking with Kal again. He gesticulates, seemingly describing to Kal what he witnessed the night before. Kal has stopped chipping away at his statue, listening with a bewildered, yet bemused, expression on his face.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: A closer view of the conversation. We can hear them now.
                
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Where is the girl?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: One of the workers, you say? She was here yesterday? 

            <p><u>Dari</u>: She had a birthmark covering much of her jaw...

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Kal gestures to the foundation the workers had been building the day before. There are no more workers, just tools and construction refuse.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: They are no longer here, Dari. They were ordered to return to their village. Low yields they must tend to, I believe.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Bah! Which village? To the north, correct?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: <i>Enki save me…</i> How should I know?! What is so special about this girl?

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari has turned around. His head is in his hand, his eyes closed pensively.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: It was a miracle. She performed a miracle, Kal. I saw it with mine own eyes.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: A miracle? A little northern girl? I suppose stranger things have happened… what exactly did she do?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: She summoned and convened with a goddess, Kal.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Well, that certainly would be a miracle…

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari has turned around and now briskly walks away, his gait filled with purpose.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Wait! Dari! Which goddess was it?!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I don’t know!

        <h2>Page 16</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari is in the temple asking a group of priestesses questions. The priestesses shake their heads.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari speaks with his subordinate, Gizzal, as some children eavesdrop. Gizzal shakes his head.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari speaks to a man surrounded by clay tablets stacked upon each other to reckless heights. He shakes his head.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari speaks to two young men who point at spots on a tablet with a map wedged into its clay. They appear to be giving Dari directions.

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari exits Uruk through its main gates. Many people flow in and out of the city. Shepherds herd buffaloes and goats. Farmers carry bundles of barley to and from the city. Merchants trade their wares to passersby. Dari carries a walking stick as he makes his way down the road with a certain bounce to his step: a man on a mission.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari is farther down the road, walking briskly. There are fewer people.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Even farther now. Only two or three people can now be seen. 

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: He is now alone on the road, walking at a more measured pace.

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Farther along, an old man approaches from the opposite direction.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Greetings!

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: They approach each other.
