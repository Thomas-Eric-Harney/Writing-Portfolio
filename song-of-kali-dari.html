        <h2>Page 1</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: A depiction of two white circles vertically overlapping each other on a black background. The top sphere contains stars, while the bottom contains a disk-shaped depiction of Earth. On the disk-earth are rivers, trees, and desert. The overlapping region between the two circles has a pearlescent white hue. </p>
        
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Before the age of man, Heaven and Earth were intertwined. Our mortal house shared with the house of Gods.</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Within this union slept <i>Lil</i>: the breath and spirit of the universe.
  
            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The circles separate. The white now swirls through and around the two circles.
        
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Once awoken, however, Lil expanded and forever separated Heaven and Earth.
  
            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The earth-circle now contains settlements dotting the landscape with a towering city brown city at its center. A reddish-brown Ziggurat can be made out at its center.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: It was at this time that man and animal began to seed this Earthly realm.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Across this wide panel are eight cuneiform symbols (in a 4x2 formation) with their English translation underneath each. From left to right: godship, truth, law, art, power, the letter, wisdom, terror. There are also many symbols in the background, smaller and blurred, implying a multitude.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Guiding the universe are the Mes: divine words that maintain harmony through all that exists. They compel every word, every marvel, and every tool.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: A depiction of seven anthropomorphic gods standing side by side. Descriptions provided below.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Among the many Gods of Heaven are seven who reign.

        <h2>Page 2</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The first god. He has a long, curled, and oiled beard. He wields two scepters and has four wings along his back.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: There is An, the genitor of all Gods and King of Heaven.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The second god. He wields two daggers. He is surrounded by swirling wind and lightning.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .and there is Enlil, God of wind and Lil.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The third god. A smiling man surrounded by reeds that holds a clay tablet, scriven with cuneiform, in his hand.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Enki. He is the lord of water and the wisest of gods. He is the keeper of all <i>Mes</i> that govern the world.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The fourth god is a woman with wide hips and hair curled in a way that resembles the Omega letter. She holds a jug of milk.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Beloved by the children is Ninhursag. The first consort of An, she is the mother goddess of the universe.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The fifth god is a man with open hands that wield nothing. He is circled by phases of the moon.
            
            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Nanna, the Lord of the Moon, and he that supervises the passage of time.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The sixth god. He wields a sword in one hand, whip in the other. The sun shines directly above his head.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .sibling to Nanna is Utu, Lord of the Sun. He illuminates all in the universe and governs truth and law.  
        
        <h2>Page 3</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: This panel is substantially larger than the previous page’s panels. It depicts a winged goddess as she lounges in the air. Reeds and barley grow in the earth beneath her. Two lions sleep amid the reeds.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Finally, there is the Goddess Inanna: Lady of passionate love and fierce ambition. Her domain is that of fertility and human fecundity. Resplendent in her glory, she harnesses. . . Namazu quit picking your nose.

            <P><strong>Panel 2</strong>: We see a wide view of two dark-brown eyes that have just opened.

            <p><u>Gizzal (FOP)</u>: Good. Now throw it away. Thank you. Now where was I… Ahh look who is awake! Say hello to Kali-Dari children!

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: A man is shown sitting himself up from a prone position upon a tan mat of reeds. He is a stout man with long brown hair that is streaked with gray. He has a paunch visible underneath his ropes. He wipes the sleep from his eyes as the children greet him. 

            <p><u>Children in unison (FOP)</u>: Hello Kali-Dari!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Hello my young scribes. How are the lessons proceeding, Mah-Gizzal?

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: We now see the rest of the room. Gizzal is a younger man with hair and beard closely shaved. He holds a clay tablet in his hand and stands before a dozen children. They are seated on reedy mats upon the floor. Namazu (the nosepicker) looks to be six or seven. In the background priests and priestesses scurry about, all with clay tablets in hand. A statue of Inanna can made out in the distance. Bundles of barley are clustered in the corner. A table behind Gizzal displays stone idols of each of the gods listed previously, with the center idol of Inanna being the largest. 

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Excellently! Namazu, tell Kali-Dari about what we have learned.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Inanna is the Lady of Uruk. We give her our food and she… um…

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Very good. Shimusa, why don’t you help Namazu.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: We see the students from a different angle. Shimusa, the student speaking, appears to be around twelve years of age and has a wide smile as she speaks. The students all have clay tablets before them. Cuneiform writing is seen wedged into them. Namazu’s finger has returned to his nose.

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Fantastic, as always. Uli, tell the Kali-Dari more about our temple.

            <p>[Uli is a heavy-set boy with a thick brow and messy brown hair]

            <p><u>Uli</u>: In the name of Inanna, we of the temple then dispense the city’s bounty to the free denizens of Uruk. The Eanna temple is led by the Ensi. He is the high priest who represents the interests of the Goddess on Earth. After him is the Kali, that’s you Kali-Dari… he administers the temple and its attendants. Next, are the Nindingi and the…

            <p><u>Dari</u>: That’s enough, Uli. Thank you. It seems the lessons are coming along splendidly, Mah-Gizzal. Each of you will be priests and counters of the highest order, I am sure. 

            <p>[Dari smiles warmly]

        <h2>Page 4</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Wide view of Dari working with a tablet as he is counting bundels of Barley. He is attended by a young man in robes. In the background worshippers pass. Some priestesses are setting incense before a stone statue of Inanna.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: ...one hundred fifty three, one hundred seventy, one hundred eighty seven, two hundred two... it seems we are missing two bundels.

            <p>[He presses wedges into his tablet]

            <p><u>Young man</u>: Yes, Kali-Dari. I will let them know at once.

            <p>[The young man bows]

            <p><strong>Panels 2, 3, 4, 5</strong>: These small panels are arranged next to each other, across the page. In sequential order they reveal Dari’s personal cylindrical seal in his hand. It is made from crystal and has a low relief wrapped around it. The next three panels depict the seal rolling over the bottom of his tablet. The imprint to the left depicts an offering made to Inanna. Inanna is depicted amid reeds and accompanied by two lions. The high-priest, Ensi, is depicted facing towards her. Behind him, are the many people of Uruk. Behind the Ensi numerous subordinate priests stand. Each wields tools that indicate their profession. The whip for the buffalo herder, the plough for the farmer, the hoe for the gardener, the tablet for the scribe, and the net for the fisherman.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Dari stands before a crowd of people along with many female priestesses. They hand out bundels of barley to the people of Uruk. Dari calls out names.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Tilhar!.... Mesharra!.... Bilu... err...Biluqah?....

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I cannot read this one… [He whispers to a female priestess beside him.]

            <p>[The priestess looks over his shoulder at the tablet.]

            <p><u>Priestess</u>: Biluda.

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: An view facing the crowd. A young girl emerges from the crowd and runs to Dari, she leads an even younger girl by the hand.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Biluda! <i>Thank you, priestess</i> [He whispers]

            <p><u>Young Girl (Lala)</u>: Kali-Dari!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: What is it Lala, I am busy.

        <h2>Page 5</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Lala tugs on Dari’s robes. The younger girl has her hand stretched out to Dari.

            <p><u>Lala</u>: My sister wants to see your seal, Kali-Dari. I told her that it shines like the sun.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see, and what is your sister’s name?

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Lilla.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: That is confusing.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari kneels before the two young girls. He pulls his crystal seal from a pocket in his robes.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Careful with this, Lilla.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The little girl holds the seal now. She looks at it through the sun, light from the crystal seal refracts onto her face.

            <p><u>Lilla</u>: Wooooow...

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Girls, how is your father?

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Fine. He spends more time with the buffalo than he does with mother, though.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see. Such is the nature of his calling, I suppose. I will see you all here next week, yes?

            [Dari Passes a bundel of Barley to Lala]

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Lala returns to the crowd with her sister. Dari returns the seal to his pocket.

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Of course, Kali-Dari. We cannot live on buffalo milk alone!

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: A view of the interior of the temple again. Kali-Dari prays, prostrated, before a statue of Inanna with his fellow priests and priestesses. Behind them are many of the people who have received their redistributed bundels of barley that they hold under their arms and in baskets. They pray.

        <h2>Pages 6 & 7</h2>

            <p><strong>Splash</strong>: A two page view of Uruk from high above. The city is expansive with the temple of Eanna sitting atop a massive Ziggurat at the center. The Ziggurat towers over the rest of the city. It is swarming with human activity and banners and painted murals decorate it much of it, top to bottom. In the distance irrigated fields of barley can be seen surrounding the city. Canals of water flow through them in grid-like patterns. The streets teem with people, goat, and buffalo.
                
        <h2>Page 8</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari leans on a half-constructed stone statue outside the temple of Eanna. He eats dates, one palm full of them, while the other throws them into his mouth. There is an older man with a chisel chipping at the statue.

            <p><u>Older Man (Kal)</u>: How’s life in the temple?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Fine, Kal. And the life of Uruk’s Master Sculptor? 
                
            <p><u>Kal</u>: Splendid! Praise Inanna, this may be my best work yet.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari looks up at the half-completed depiction, its face still an amorphous blob.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: How can you tell?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Naturally I can sense such things.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Naturally.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Kal</u>: I cannot say I am happy with the laborers the temple has provided.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari spots a man, brandishing a club, yelling at a group of laborers close to where he and Kal are standing. The laborers work on the foundation of a building.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: They seem adequate enough...

            <p><u>Kal</u>: They were borrowed from the northern settlements, but they did not come here willingly and they have little experience. Such a combination begets poor craftsmanship. And to be truthful, I regret that my works should require such hardships.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari brushes his hands against his robes after finishing the last date.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: First, they are not <i>your</i> works. They are Inanna’s.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Second, we protect these people from the mountain tribes. In return, they do work in the name of Inanna, whom they love. And, look, their work enriches our temples, allowing us to care for the people of Uruk. This is a good thing, Kal.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: I suppose.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari assesses the group of slaves again, but this time sees a young girl among their number. She hands a bowel of water to an older worker.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: A closer view of the girl’s face. She has beautiful dark eyes and a distinct birth mark that covers most of her lower jaw. She return's Dari's gaze.

            <p><u>Kal (FOP)</u>: Just look at them Dari. Wretched lot...

        <h2>Page 9</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari pries his gaze away (a look of consternation on his face) as Kal tugs his robes to get his attention. Kal gestures to the street where a large group of men are passing by.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: A wide shot of the men passing by. They are dressed in leather tunics and skirts. Most of them wield slings or large wooden clubs. Two or three at the front of the group have axes of flint, gleaming obsidian daggers, or spears with copper tips. Many of them look terrified.

            <p><u>Dari (FOP)</u>: Ahh. A lion devoured a travelling administrator, two days past. The Ensi commanded that a lot be drawn to determine the band that would track the beast and capture the beast. Once they return, the Ensi plans to slay the captured beast himself.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: A view of Dari and Kal as the last of the amateur lion trackers pass by.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Potters and weavers going lion hunting… Inanna protect them. 

            <p>[Kal shakes his head.]</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: They are led by Uruk’s greatest hunters, Kal. Besides, they won’t be killing it, just tracking it.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: And capturing it... they look petrified, Dari. They aren’t meant for that sort of work.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: <i>Everybody</i> in Uruk is subject to be drawn in a lot, Kal. Regardless of station.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A silent panel as Kal considers this and continues to chip away at his statue.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari turns and starts to walk away.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: <i>Everybody...?</i>

            <p>[Dari throws his head down in exasperation.]</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: We are too important to the temple and to the Ensi, Kal. Although I do not know why he values you so, old man. You are feeble-minded and your statues are horrendous.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Haha! That’s the Goddess you’ve just insulted, Dari!

        <h2>Page 10</h2>
                
            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: A view of Uruk at night. The moon hangs full in the sky. It is deep orange and shines on the city below. Torches wrap around tiers of the Ziggurat, though the rest of the city is largely dark.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: We return to the temple interior. Dari points as he instructs temple attendants while they carry things up the stairs of the temple.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: An angle of the street leading away from the temple. Up the street, a small girl watches Dari and the workers.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari stops what he is doing, perhaps sensing the girl's gaze. He looks at the girl.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: It is the northern girl that he saw earlier in the day, the one with the birthmark on her chin. The moon’s orange light illuminates her face. Her dark eyes reflect the light.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: She turns away and darts into a nearby alley.

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: Close-up of Dari’s face. He looks perplexed. There is something about this girl.

        <h2>Page 11</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari trots down the street toward the alley she disappeared into.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: A view from behind Dari as he pokes his head into the alley. He sees her turn a corner into another alley.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari emerges into a lit courtyard. There are a dozen men and women drinking and laughing around a fountain. He is already breathing heavily, slouching from fatigue.  

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari gingerly steps around the revelers and spots something ahead.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: From Dari’s perspective, we see the girl, just barely, as she disappears down yet another alleyway.

        <h2>Page 12</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari peers down the alley the girl has just turned down. It has an almost comically steep incline ascending almost as if toward to the orange moon that hangs above.

            <p>[A word balloon with a question mark hovers over Dari’s head.]</p>

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari looks back before he ascends. The revelers he had passed are now gone. No trace of them remains.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari scrambles up the steep alleyway. The sky above him has taken on an unnatural, pink-purple hue.
                
            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari continues climbing. The alley is somehow even steeper. The houses surrounding him are now slightly lop-sided. Odd, non-cuneiformic symbols are painted on the walls. Purple light bathes the area around him.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari reaches the top of the incline and then emerges from the alley. He is now bathed in a brilliant, shimmering blue light. He squints towards its source.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Same angle as above. Dark drops to his knees. 

        <h2>Page 13</h2>

            <p><strong>Full Page</strong>: We see what Dari sees: an open courtyard with a goddess at its center. This goddess is unlike Inanna or any of the other gods referenced earlier. She walks elegantly out of a yawning, teardrop-shaped rupture in the scenery. Her exceptionally long hair floats in the air as if she were submerged in water, reaching out like tendrils towards the northern girl. The goddess has a dark complexion and eyes like prisms. The spatial maw from which she emerges reveals glimpses of floating amorphous blobs of light. Impossibly, there is no longer a moon in the sky but two planets. The larger one is dark red while the other is black. The buildings surrounding the courtyard seem to be leaning towards the goddess, seemingly ready to buckle and collapse. The goddess augustly extends a closed hand to the young girl. The young girl is on her knees, praying.

        <h2>Page 14</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: A close-up of Dari. Tears stream down his face as he stares in awe. A wash of colors bathe his face. (Think Dave in the climax of <i>2001.</i>)

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari faints.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: All black.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari awakes suddenly. A stick prods his face.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: We see it is the child Namazu (the nosepicker) who wields the stick.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Kali-Dari...?

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Dari is on his feet, spinning. The courtyard he is in appears completely normal. A crowd has gathered and watches him, amused.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Kali-Dari...? Are you ok?

        <h2>Page 15</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Through passing crowds we see Dari talking with Kal again. He gesticulates, seemingly describing to Kal what he witnessed the night before. Kal has stopped chipping away at his statue, listening with a bewildered, yet bemused, expression on his face.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: A closer view of the conversation. We can hear them now.
                
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Where is the girl?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: One of the workers, you say? She was here yesterday? 

            <p><u>Dari</u>: She had a birthmark covering much of her jaw...

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Kal gestures to the foundation the workers had been building the day before. There are no more workers, just tools and construction refuse.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: They are no longer here, Dari. They were ordered to return to their village. Low yields they must tend to, I believe.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Bah! Which village? To the north, correct?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: <i>Enki save me…</i> How should I know?! What is so special about this girl?

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari has turned around. His head is in his hand, his eyes closed pensively.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: It was a miracle. She performed a miracle, Kal. I saw it with mine own eyes.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: A miracle? A little northern girl? I suppose stranger things have happened… what exactly did she do?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: She summoned and convened with a goddess, Kal.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Well, that certainly would be a miracle…

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari has turned around and now briskly walks away, his gait filled with purpose.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Wait! Dari! Which goddess was it?!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I don’t know!

        <h2>Page 16</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari is in the temple asking a group of priestesses questions. The priestesses shake their heads.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari speaks with his subordinate, Gizzal, as some children eavesdrop. Gizzal shakes his head.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari speaks to a man surrounded by clay tablets stacked upon each other to reckless heights. He shakes his head.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari speaks to two young men who point at spots on a tablet with a map wedged into its clay. They appear to be giving Dari directions.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari prays before the statue of Inanna.

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari exits Uruk through its main gates. Many people flow in and out of the city. Shepherds herd buffaloes and goats. Farmers carry bundles of barley to and from the city. Merchants trade their wares to passersby. Dari carries a walking stick as he makes his way down the road with a certain bounce to his step: a man on a mission.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari is farther down the road, walking briskly. There are fewer people.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Even farther now. Only two or three people can now be seen. 

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: He is now alone on the road, walking at a more measured pace.

        <h2>Page 18</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Farther along, an old man approaches from the opposite direction.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Greetings!

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: They approach each other.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Greetings, my friend. Inanna guides us.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: They stop before each other as the old man begins rummaging through his satchel. 

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Yes yes, so I’m told. How about an exchange? I have dates if you have water.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The two sit on a large log beneath the shade of a date palm, together on the side of the road. The old man drinks water from a skin while Dari chews pensively on dates.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: What brings a priest outside of the city?
            
            <p><u>Dari</u>: I’m looking for a girl. A special girl. She is of the northern lands, I believe.
                
            <p><u>Old Man</u>: I see. And what’s so special about this northern girl.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Same as above, though now Dari is drinking from the water skin and the old man basks in the shade.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I witnessed her communal with a god. 

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Mhm.
 
            <p><u>Dari</u>: You don’t seem impressed by that. Does the idea not excite you, old man?

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Why should it?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Ha. Why shouldn’t it?

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The old man rises to his feet and audibly cracks his back. Dari shakes his head as he returns the skin to his satchel.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Where I hail, such communions are common indeed, youngling.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see, and where do you hail?

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: You wouldn’t know it.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: What a surprise...

        <h2>Page 19</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The old man sits down, ignoring Dari’s comment.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Tell me, youngling...

                <p><u>Dari’s</u>: I’m 55.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The man slaps his knee and flashes a wide grin, revealing several missing teeth.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: ...and I’m 82. That makes you young!

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: He stops, a slightly confused look on his face.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Now, where was I...
                    
                <p><u>Dari</u>: I do not know.
                        
            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The old man’s eyes brighten as he remembers.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Oh yes, what are your designs with the girl? Give her robes, induct her into your clan?  
                    
                <p><u>Dari</u>: No. I merely wish to ask the name of the goddess she summoned. I will then record the name.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: I see. Why is this goddess’ name so important?

                <p><u>Dari</u>: I am certain that she is unknown to me. She is not scriven in any records.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The old man thinks, head in hand.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: That doesn’t answer my question.

                <p><u>Dari</u>: Because names are vital, old man. And our knowledge even more so. It is my duty to add this knowledge to the repositories of the temple. For posterity...

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Well, I wish you the best, I suppose. Although you might encounter trouble.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The old man rises from his seat and begins squatting, his knees audibly cracking, as he begins preparing to return to the road. Dari looks up at the old man.
            
                <p><u>Dari</u>: Why do you say that?

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Not all Gods wish to be named, youngling.

        <h2>Page 20</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari enters a large town. Potters ply their elaborately painted wares in nearby stalls.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He passes through crowds. This town is not as large or busy as Uruk, but still has its merchants and craftsmen plying their trade. Though, the herders and farmers are more prevalent. Uruk representatives can be seen counting bundles of barley before a farmer, his head bowed in deference. 

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: A local woman directs Dari towards a building across the street.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari enters the building where two men are playing some sort of game, throwing small wooden trinkets onto the floor.

                <p><u>Dari</u>: Good day. I am Kali-Dari of Uruk. This is a temple outpost, yes?

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The men, caught unawares, stand up suddenly.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Yes, Kali-Dari! What service may we provide?</p>

                <p><u>Dari</u>: I am looking for a girl who would have passed through this town. Maybe two or three days past. She has a birthmark across her chin.

                <p>[Dari gestures across his chin with his open palm]</p>

                <p><u>Man #2</u>: Yes! I remember her! Hard to miss. Queer little thing. She and her father were returning to their village. Should be three villages down the northerly road, Kali-Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Dari is now outside as the two men escort him.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Kali-Dari, you should know, a lion prowls this area. It devoured our resident scribe. And our riverwright. And several locals as well. 

                <p><u>Man #2:</u> ...and several locals as well.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Yes, thank you. I have been informed of the beast. The Ensi plans to slay the creature himself.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Well, pardon my saying so, Kali-Dari, but he’d best do so soon. Some of our men fear travelling to the neighboring villages to collect tribute. 

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I will alert the Ensi as soon as I return to Uruk, my friends. Or perhaps I shall slay the beast myself? Haha. 

        <h2>Page 21</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari enters a small village as the sun sets. There are markedly fewer people here, and the appearance of the village differs from the town. There are fewer abodes of timber, and more of reeds and mudbrick. 

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari notices some commotion at the center of the town where the locals are gathered.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: He approaches the scene. Two men yell over each other, though the words cannot be made out. One of the men is clearly a local, while the other is an administrator of some sort from Uruk. Dari asks someone nearby he recognizes, by his dress, as a Uruk native as well.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> What is happening here?

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> Kali-Dari! What brings you so far out of the city?!

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Temple business. Tell me, why are they shouting at each other?

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The collector gestures to the two men as he explains.

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> We arrived this evening to collect tribute, Kali-Dari. However, this village’s harvest was notably lacking. Suspiciously so, claims our supervisor. He suspects they have been pilfering.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: We see Dari’s gaze land on a small boy who stands close to the arguing local. The boy appears emaciated, his stomach protruding.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Pilfering seems unlikely...

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Same view as Panel 4.

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> That may be so, but it seems we have upset their leader.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Their <i>leader</i>?

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> Yes, Kali-Dari. It is so. I was just as surprised as you. Some of these far-flung villages have established a marginal hierarchy of sorts. For example, take this raving man, he has quite the head for numbers. Better than me, anyways. So, I think, for this, he argues on behalf of his people.

        <h2>Page 22</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The local leader stops yelling, seemingly mid-sentence, as he spots Kali-Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The local man stalks to Kali-Dari with Collector #2 hurriedly trailing him.

                <p><u>Leader:</u> Priest! This must stop! We cannot pay these loathsome tributes any longer!

                <p>[Dari raises his palms as if to sooth the man]</p>

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Calm yourself. Tell me your troubles.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The local leader puts two fingers up, impertinently close to Dari’s face. The collectors both cringe. 

                <p><u>Leader:</u> Two! We have been paying tribute to two towns! For months! If this persists, we will not be able to feed ourselves through winter.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I see. That should not be the case. I will take this matter to the temple, personally. I promise you this.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari points to Collector #1.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> You. Hand me a tablet.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari produces his crystal seal.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: A view over the tablet as Dari rolls the seal across the bottom.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> You are relieved of your duty to the temple. At least until we can settle this matter. I <i>will</i> discuss this with the Ensi, my friend.

        <h2>Page 23</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The leader spits onto the ground. Dari takes a step back, affronted.

                <p><u>Leader:</u> It is the Ensi who harries us so!

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari’s demeanor flares as he loses his temper for the first time.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Enough! Watch your tongue! The Ensi sows order in this land! You owe him your life!

                <p><u>Leader:</u> Order!? Ha! We have known order long before Uruk infested this land like rats. This is not order, this is...is.. confusion!

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The man storms off with the emaciated boy trailing behind him, gripping his father’s skirts.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari throws his hands up in frustration as he turns away. The collectors look to each other with relief in their eyes, as if the worst outcome had been avoided. The people of the village disperse. 

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The sun is down now. Dari rests against a rock, his head leaning against his fist. The moon hangs above, a slightly pink tone to its hue.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: He closes his eyes and falls asleep.

        <h2>Page 24</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari has resumed his journey. He walks down the road, alone.     

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari reaches another village. This village is primarily composed of homes of the reed and mudbrick variety. As he fills his waterskin at a well, a young woman approaches him. Very few people can be seen.

                <p><u>Young Woman (Kash):</u> A long way from Uruk, priest.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I know.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Have you come to trade?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> No.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Shame. I am craving pomegranate.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari drinks from his waterskin.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> I hear that Uruk smells like shit. Is this true? A passing riverwright once told me the whole city smells of dog shit.

                <p>[Kari Doesn't Answer]</p>

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Well, it smells like shit here. And if it smells like shit here, it must almost certainly smell like a mountain of shit in Uruk.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A silent panel as Dari thoughtfully considers the question. Beads of water drip from his beard.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari returns his waterskin to his satchel.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> That is a wise assumption.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Hah hah! I knew it.

                <p>[Beat]</p>

                <p><u>Kash:</u> I am Kash.

                <p>[Beat]</p>

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Dari.

        <h2>Page 25</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The two of them now walk through the village together.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> What brings you so far from Uruk?

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari follows Kash under a tree. There are other youths there, lounging in the shade. They look up at Dari and Kash and watch as the two converse.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I am looking for a girl.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Long way to come for a girl. There must be thousands of girls in Uruk.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Same as above.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> This girl is unique. She shares some...connection with a goddess.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> A goddess?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Yes. I witnessed the communion. The goddess was… immaculate. Her exalted form was truly beyond my humble ken...

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A silent pause as Kash (and the eavesdropping youths) consider Dari's words.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Kash offers her response, her palm casually extended.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> “Mmhmm, I see. Tell me, are you looking to fuck this Goddess?”

                <p>[The youths explode in laughter]</p>

        <h2>Page 26</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The youths continue laughing. Dari buries his forehead in his hand.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Don’t be foolish. I need only her name. So that I may be recorded.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Kash smiles sympathetically. 

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Named? Are the gods children, Dari? Gods do not have names, you silly man.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari turns and walks away. Kash follows.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> And another thing!

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Kash, I appreciate your people's hospitality, but I must be on my way.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Kash catches up to Dari and passes him. She walks backwards as she lectures him.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> What are we to you? Hm? Magic farmers?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> You are an annoyance.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> This poor little girl does not need some strange, robed man interrogating her regarding his dreams.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari stops in his tracks.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> It was not a dream! I saw her, a goddess, emerge from heaven itself.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> So you say.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Enki save me. Will the people in this girl’s village be so insufferable as you?

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Dari resumes walking, now leaving the village. Kash stands a good distance behind him as she calls out.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> How the fuck should I know?! I don’t live there! I live here!

        <h2>Page 27</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari moves exhaustedly down the road. He approaches a small village. Here the huts differ from any of the previous settlements, with stones instead of mudbricks. The sun sets. The sky is a swirl of pink and scarlet clouds. 

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari questions a passing buffalo herder. The herder’s goat companion chews at Dari’s robes, though Dari pays no attention too it. Dari gestures towards his face as if to describe the girl’s birthmark.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The man points down the road to a small home where an old woman sits outside. The woman stares at the ground.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari approaches the old woman.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Innana guides us. I am Dari. I... well... I seek a young girl. I believe her to be your daughter.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The woman looks up at Dari. Tears streak her face.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: She points a long, slender finger to a recently dug grave not far from the home. A black-painted rock adorns the freshly dug soil.

        <h2>Page 28:</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: We see Dari’s face, devastated. Tears fall between the wrinkles of his face.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He returns his gaze to the mother.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Ninhursag guides her now.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: At Dari’s words, the woman looks up at Dari with a quizzical look on her face.

                <p><u>Mother:</u> Where have you come from?

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: An angle of the two of them from above. 

                <p><u>Dari:</u> ...Uruk.

                <p>[The mother spits on the ground]</p>

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Same as above.

                <p><u>Mother:</u> Accursed is Uruk, felling so many before their time. She was home but a day ere she took ill. The city has slain my Sura, of that you can be sure.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: A view of Dari’s face stricken face.

        <h2>Page 29</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari squats before the woman as he wipes the tears from his face with his sleeve.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Woman, I saw your daughter several days ago… in the city. She was... I witnessed her communal with a goddess. Though I recognized your daughter, I did not the goddess. I came here to, respectfully, collect from your daughter the name of this goddess. So that I may record it... Perhaps you...

                <p><u>Mother:</u> The gods walk where they please, priest. Even in Uruk. Who are you to think otherwise?

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: 

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I would never...

                <p>[The woman interjects]</p>

                <p><u>Mother:</u> Ah, but you would. Your temple claims the water, the seeds, and the gods themselves, does it not? It bends the river and it herds the people. Only earthly tribute, you say, can satisfy its hunger. But does it not feed on life itself?

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Same above, though Dari’s has adopted a sunken posture. 

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The mother continues, her arms gesturing around her.

                <p><u>Mother:</u> So my Sura convened with a goddess. And behold! — all the good it did. It did not save her from your forsaken city did it?

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Silence.

        <h2>Page 30</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari leaves the village. His shoulders sag, visibly tired. The sun has gone all the way down. The stars are many, with the Perseus Arm filling much of the panel. 

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He stops beside the path and lays down.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Rolled pitifully into a fetal position, he weeps.

        <h2>Page 31</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Daytime has returned. Dari walks languidly somewhere outside of the town. He appears utterly defeated, exhausted. Presumably, he now returns to Uruk.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He approaches Kash’s village again.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: From afar, he sees an Uruk collector berating some of the locals. A club and slingshot hang from his belt. He has gathered several local, working aged men and some boys and girls.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari rushes over.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> What is going on here?

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The collector spins around, recognizing the call of authority.

                <p><u>Collector (Hazi):</u> Kali-Dari! What are you doing here!?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> What is your name?

                <p><u>Hazi:</u> Hazi...

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Hazi, answer my question.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: 

                <p><u>Hazi:</u> Temple requisitions, Kali-Dari. Servile tribute... for the new wing of the White Temple...
                    
        <h2>Page 32</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari curtly seizes the tablet and tosses it aside.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> These people have been relieved of their obligations, Hazi. 

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Hazi blanches, but the faces of the workers immediately brighten. They promptly begin dispersing.

                <p><u>Hazi:</u> but... but... Kali-Dari, I must collect. The Ensi expects the temple’s completion by end of season.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari starts toward the man, his fists clinched.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I have spoken!
                    
                <p><u>Hazi:</u> Kali-Dari, The Ensi will…

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari grabs Hazi by his tunic. He opens his mouth to berate the man, but instead a rock comes flying from the side and crushes Hazi’s skull.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Blood has splattered Dari’s face. He drops the limp body to the ground and looks to the one who cast the stone.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: We see it is Kash. She stands upon a well. She wields a slingshot and a satisfied smile on her face.

        <h2>Page 33</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari looks to Kash in horror.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Kash! What have you done!?

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari scrambles towards Kash. She nimbly bounces from the well.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Kash, with a look up motherly patience, meets Dari’s gaze and places her hand on his shoulder.
                
                <p><u>Kash:</u> I killed that man with a rock, Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari wildly runs his fingers through his hair, face aghast.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> But Why!?

                <p><u>Kash:</u> What a question? “Why!?” Because he was vermin. And because he conspired to steal our children and work half the village to death. Winter approaches. What else was I supposed to do?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Kash, I was... I had stopped this...

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari’s hands have dropped down, his hair a mess. Kash’s shoulders begin shaking from laughter.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Heheh...

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Kash continues to laugh, her eyes closed in delight. A large group of children rush by the two of them in the direction of dead Hazi, presumably to go inspect the body.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Hahhaha...

        <h2>Page 34</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Kash points at Dari as she laughs even harder. The last of the kids stream by. One straggler, a young girl, stops to see what Kash is laughing at.
                
                <p><u>Kash:</u> Heahahhaha!

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The little girl, eager to join, begins laughing at Dari as well. She begins slapping her knobby knees and pointing at Dari, just as Kash is. 

                <p></p>[Laughing continues]<p></p>

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Now the rest of the kids come running back to see what the fuss is all about. Quickly ascertaining that Dari is the object of Kash’s ridicule, they all begin laughing uproariously at Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari turns around and, as the laughter continues behind him, he slinks away, face haggard and drawn.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: He exits the village. Kash yells over the children’s laughter.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Good luck Dari!

        <h2>Page 35</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari limply walks the empty road.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He passes by a familiar village, the one with the leader with a head for numbers.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari sees the leader. The man, appearing initially angered, looks at Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A close-up view of the leader’s face. After getting a better look at Dari, and the condition he’s in, the man simply offers a pitying nod to Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari returns the nod. Hecontinues walking.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: He sees the emaciated boy from before, only now the boy holds a piece of brown barley bread. Dari smiles meekly at the boy and waves.

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: The boy reciprocates with a wide, toothy smile.

            <p><strong>Panel 8</strong>: Dari leaves the village behind.

        <h2>Page 36</h2>
                
            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The sun approaches the horizon as Dari reaches the large town from before, the one with temple outpost. The sinking sun casts shadows of the buildings away from limping Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari enters the temple outpost. The same two men are inside, playing the same game, in the very same squatting positions.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Hello again.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The men start and stand up suddenly, spinning towards Dari’s voice, just as they did before.

                <p><u>Both Men (in unison):</u> Kali-Dari! 

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> You have returned... 

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A wide view of the sun disappearing behind the horizon.

        <h2>Page 37</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The three men are now gathered around a table, inspecting a clay tablet with a regional wedged into it. Dari points to the tablet.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Here, here, and... here.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: A view of Dari’s hand as he points to three symbols on the map, each aligned along the same road.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> These three successive villages along the northerly road. They are exempt from their tributary obligations and from any future requisitions. 

                <p><u>Man #2:</u> Of course, Kali-Dari.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: We see Dari’s crystal seal in hand yet again.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> May we ask why, Kali-Dari?

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari rolls his seal across a tablet, thereby officiating his decree.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari calmly returns the seal to a pocket in his robes.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> You may not.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The second man points to the second location (Kash’s village) on the tablet.

                <p><u>Man #2:</u> This village… here. Kali-Dari, tonight one of our collectors should be returning from this site with servile tribute. When he arrives, shall we send the workers back?

        <h2>Page 38</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari begins to walk out of the building, silent as he considers the question.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Dari turns to them.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> There will be no need. The collector is dead. I passed his corpse on the road. By the looks of it, eaten by that wild lion you warned me of.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Gah! Kali-Dari, that lion! The Ensi must slay the beast before it eats all of us!

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: We see Dari exit the building, into the night. Speech bubbles emerge from within the building as the men inside continue to banter.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Haha! She won’t be eating you, Guza. You smell like dogshit.

                <p><u>Man #2:</u> Shut up, Manishti!

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A birds eye perspective as Dari walks further down the road. The banter continues.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Me on the other hand? She’ll be eating me next, I’m sure of it. I smell like dates and sweet milk.

                <p><u>Man #2:</u> Let us pray to Inanna that you are right.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari exits the town. The lights of Uruk can be made out in the distance, the painted exterior of the ziggurat towering well above the rest of the city and its walls. There are no stars in the sky, only the solitary moon.

        <h2>Page 39</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari stops before a large boulder on the side of the road.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He drops to his knees as he retrieves his seal from his pocket. Sweat drips from his brow.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: We see the crystal seal in his hand: the side of the seal that depicts the offerings before Inanna.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari places the seal atop the boulder.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: A distant view as Dari’s raises a rock above his head.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Dari smashes the rock down upon the crystal seal.

        <h2>Page 40</h2>
                
            <p><strong>Full Page</strong>: In the foreground, the smashed, crystalline pieces of the seal lay in the dirt, glittering with reflected moonlight. They bear a marked resemblance to the stars in the sky. In the background, Dari returns to Uruk.</p>

        <h2>Page 41</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari walks down the road, a handful of stars visible in the sky.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: As Dari walks, he notices the flicker of a campfire to the east of the road.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Dari turns away from the road and towards the fire. He resumes walking. 

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari approaches the fire. We see the travelling Old Man is sitting next to the fire, staring at the sky. Dari sits by the fire and begins warming his hands. He stares blankly into the fire.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Old Man:</u> If it isn't the Master Namer himself, of our Great Temple of Eanna! Well met again, my friend.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Dari responds, though he does not look away from the fire, nor does his demeanor change.

            <p><u>Dari:</u> That is not my title old man...

            <p><u>Old Man:</u> Is that so? Then what is?

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Silence

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: Dari picks up a stick and inspects it.

            <p><u>Dari:</u> It matters not.

            <p><strong>Panel 8</strong>: He begins poking the fire. Embers stir and begin swirling upward. 

            <p><u>Old Man:</u> I see.
                
            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Old Man:</u> How would you like a story, young man?

        <h2>Page 42</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari pokes the fire again. Bright embers scatter in disarray.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: He then casually tosses the stick behind him, its burning end spiraling through the darkness.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I couldn’t stop you if I tried. 

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The old man pulls out a reed pipe from his satchel.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Wise words indeed. 

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: He licks his lips and begins to play.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: As the old man plays the embers from the fire begin to proliferate and swirl.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: A close-up view of the embers swirling together en masse.

        <p>Page 43</p>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The embers swirl into the shape of a man and a boy standing next to each other. [From this point the Old Man’s tale will be depicted by the swirling embers].

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Behold, Master Namer. The tale of a father and son.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The depiction of a small village, not unlike the final village on Dari's journey north.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The son, and his loving father, hailed from small village far to the west.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The village, we see, resides between an ocean and a desert.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Nestled, it was, between the endless waters and the barren deserts.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: A view of villagers fishing the waters with nets.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Those in the village wanted for none, as the sea was bountiful and the desert cool.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: A view of the sun setting. 

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Indeed, this village was blessed. For come every night, once the sun departed…

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: Godly figures emerge from the desert. They vary in size and form. Some are tall and lean, others short and wide. Some are animals. Some are trees. Some appear only vaguely terrestrial. They shine brightly. Behind the gods, in the distance towards the desert, is a large mountain that towers above the scene.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Gods would descend from the desert mountain they called home. They would cross the sands and convene with the people of the village.

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: The gods now dance with the people of the village. The god-trees sway.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The gods brought music and drink. They would dance with the people of the village, and offer wisdoms forgotten.

            <p><strong>Panel 8</strong>: One of the stranger looking gods kneels on one knee before the son. It has a tuna for a head and antlers that emerge from its boney back.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Open-handed, the gods dispensed their beauty and their words. 

        <h2>Page 44</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The gods have grouped and raised their arms to the sky. Stars descend to the Earth.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> And every night the gods would call the nameless stars from the sky…

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The stars begin to coalesce into diminutive human shapes, even shorter than the son.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> and the stars, too, would dance.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Gods, stars, and villagers dance in a swirling mass, each blending into the next.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> For centuries these divine visitations persisted.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The son sits by himself, on a rock, to the side of the revelry.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> However, as the son matured, as boys always do, he grew a terrible curiosity.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The boy now pulls at the hand of one of the gods.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Each night, he would question the gods: “What is your name?, “From where do you come?, “Why have you come?”

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The gods continue to dance, ignoring the boy.
                
                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The gods ignored the young boy. Perhaps such questions bored them? Perhaps they had no answers at all. Who can tell?

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: The boy sulks away from the group as he looks to the now starless sky.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> So it was that the boy’s curiosity was never sated.

            <p><strong>Panel 8</strong>: The boy now looks to the desert with the mountain in the distance.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The boy lingered on these questions. Try as he might, he could not escape their allure.

        <h2>Page 45</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The father speaks to his son, his hand on the boy’s shoulder.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The boy’s father tried in vain to placate the boy.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: As his father speaks, the boy looks to the desert again.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> One day the boy resolved to enter the desert. He would ascend the mountain from which he knew the gods came. He would <i>see</i> where they lived and perhaps answer these questions that dogged him so.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The father gestures emphatically to the boy.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The father begged the boy not to attempt such folly, but the boy was steadfast in his intention.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The father and son walk through the desert together toward the looming mountain.
                
                <p><u>Old Man:</u> So it was that when the son set out for the mountain, so too did the father. For it is ever a father’s duty to protect his children.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The father helps the son climb the mountain, boosting the boy up a large boulder.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The two of them traveled the cool desert, and together, they climbed the mountain of the gods. For weeks they climbed perilous cliffs and traversed treacherous chasms.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The father and son sleep beside each other between two chasms.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> At night, high in the mountain, they slept that much closer to the stars. Though the stars paid did not descend as they did before.

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: The father and son reach a rocky summit.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Time passed — perhaps weeks, maybe months. Neither could say. But reach the summit, they did.

            <p><strong>Panel 8</strong>: Wider view of the summit emerging above clouds: nothing but the rocky peak and the stars in the sky. The father and son look around, searching for godly signs. 

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> ...only to find nothing. No gods resided there, it seemed. Only wistful stones adorned its peak.

        <h2>Page 46</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: The boy shakes his fists at the sky. The father watches in fear from behind a boulder.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The boy furiously entreated the cowardly gods to descend and reveal themselves. This he did for days.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: The boy, with his head hanging down, leaves the summit with his father. The father rests his hand on the boy’s back in comfort. 

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Inconsolable, the boy agreed to descend the mountain and accompany his father home, though he was loathe to do so.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: The father and son return to the village.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> When they returned to the village, they found a terrible fate had befallen their home.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: The sun sets and the people of the village stand at the edge of the desert. They look into the distance. 

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The gods had ceased their nightly visitations. No longer did they revel; no longer did they dance or sing. No longer did the stars descend...

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The villagers convene beside a fire in spirited discussion. The son sulks by himself away from the others.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Though the village grieved, none were as bereft as the son. For he knew it was his actions alone that had angered the gods so.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The boy sits by himself on the beach, staring into the sea. His father watches him, his posture suggesting concern.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The son sunk into a deep sorrow. The father followed.

            <p><strong>Panel 7</strong>: The boy walks into the ocean.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> One day, the boy vanished. Perhaps as penitence, or perhaps out of shame, he never returned to the village.

            <p><strong>Panel 8</strong>: The father falls to his knees, weeping.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> The father wept great tears that night. However...

        <h2>Page 47</h2>

            <p><strong>Full Page</strong>: The gods have returned and dance again with the villagers. The stars fall from the sky, assuming their child-like forms. The father watches from a distance in distress.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> ...that very night, to the father's dismay, as the sun disappeared behind the horizon, the gods returned.

        <h2>Page 48</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: We see Dari and the Old Man around the fire again. The Old Man pulls the reed pipe away from his lips. The embers settle and return to the fire. Dari stares into the fire, visibly disturbed by the story.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: Silence.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: Silence.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari looks up to the Old Man.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Is the story true?

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: The old man returns the reed pipe to his satchel, a look of serious calm on his face.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Perhaps, couldn’t say.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: The old man pulls dates from his satchel and begins snacking, he extends a palmful to Dari.

                <p><u>Old Man:</u> Date?

        <h2>Page 49</h2>

            <p><strong>Full Page</strong>: A close-up view of Dari’s haggard face. His dark, haunted eyes reflect the fire.

        <h2>Page 50</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Dari is on the road again, alone. He limps slowly, dragging dirt clouds behind him.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: A view over Dari’s shoulders, the long road extending into the distance. Uruk can be made out in the distance.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: He continues walking.

            <p><strong>Panel 4</strong>: Dari stops in his tracks.

            <p><strong>Panel 5</strong>: Another close-up of Dari’s face, though now dispalying a look of utter terror.

            <p><strong>Panel 6</strong>: We see from his perspective. A wild lion stands at the center of the road, picking meat from a human carcass. A club rests not far from the body.

        <h2>Page 51</h2>

            <p><strong>Panel 1</strong>: A wide landscape view of Dari and the lion. The lion looks up from her meal.

            <p><strong>Panel 2</strong>: A close-up of the lion. Blood covers her mouth. She looks calmly into Dari’s eyes.

            <p><strong>Panel 3</strong>: A close-up of Dari’s face. He looks petrified, sweat beading on his forehead.
