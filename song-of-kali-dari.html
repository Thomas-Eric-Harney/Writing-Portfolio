            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: A depiction of two white circles vertically overlapping each other on a black background. The top sphere contains stars, while the bottom contains a disk-shaped depiction of Earth. On the disk-earth are rivers, trees, and desert. The overlapping region between the two circles has a pearlescent white hue. </p>
        
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Before the age of man, Heaven and Earth were intertwined. Our mortal house shared with the house of Gods.</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Within this union slept <i>Lil</i>: the breath and spirit of the universe.
  
            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: The circles separate. The white now swirls through and around the two circles.
        
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Once awoken, however, Lil expanded and forever separated Heaven and Earth.
  
            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The earth-circle now contains settlements dotting the landscape with a towering city brown city at its center. A reddish-brown Ziggurat can be made out at its center.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: It was at this time that man and animal began to seed this Earthly realm.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Across this wide panel are eight cuneiform symbols (in a 4x2 formation) with their English translation underneath each. From left to right: godship, truth, law, art, power, the letter, wisdom, terror. There are also many symbols in the background, smaller and blurred, implying a multitude.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Guiding the universe are the Mes: divine words that maintain harmony through all that exists. They compel every word, every marvel, and every tool.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: A depiction of seven anthropomorphic gods standing side by side. Descriptions provided below.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Among the many Gods of Heaven are seven who reign.

        <h2>Page 2</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: The first god. He has a long, curled, and oiled beard. He wields two scepters and has four wings along his back.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: There is An, the genitor of all Gods and King of Heaven.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: The second god. He wields two daggers. He is surrounded by swirling wind and lightning.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .and there is Enlil, God of wind and Lil.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The third god. A smiling man surrounded by reeds that holds a clay tablet, scriven with cuneiform, in his hand.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Enki. He is the lord of water and the wisest of gods. He is the keeper of all <i>Mes</i> that govern the world.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: The fourth god is a woman with wide hips and hair curled in a way that resembles the Omega letter. She holds a jug of milk.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Beloved by the children is Ninhursag. The first consort of An, she is the mother goddess of the universe.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: The fifth god is a man with open hands that wield nothing. He is circled by phases of the moon.
            
            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .there is Nanna, the Lord of the Moon, and he that supervises the passage of time.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: The sixth god. He wields a sword in one hand, whip in the other. The sun shines directly above his head.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: . . .sibling to Nanna is Utu, Lord of the Sun. He illuminates all in the universe and governs truth and law.  
        
        <h2>Page 3</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: This panel is substantially larger than the previous page’s panels. It depicts a winged goddess as she lounges in the air. Reeds and barley grow in the earth beneath her. Two lions sleep amid the reeds.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Finally, there is the Goddess Inanna: Lady of passionate love and fierce ambition. Her domain is that of fertility and human fecundity. Resplendent in her glory, she harnesses. . . Namazu quit picking your nose.

            <P><b>Panel 2</b>: We see a wide view of two dark-brown eyes that have just opened.

            <p><u>Gizzal (FOP)</u>: Good. Now throw it away. Thank you. Now where was I… Ahh look who is awake! Say hello to Kali-Dari children!

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: A man is shown sitting himself up from a prone position upon a tan mat of reeds. He is a stout man with long brown hair that is streaked with gray. He has a paunch visible underneath his ropes. He wipes the sleep from his eyes as the children greet him. 

            <p><u>Children in unison (FOP)</u>: Hello Kali-Dari!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Hello my young scribes. How are the lessons proceeding, Mah-Gizzal?

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: We now see the rest of the room. Gizzal is a younger man with hair and beard closely shaved. He holds a clay tablet in his hand and stands before a dozen children. They are seated on reedy mats upon the floor. Namazu (the nosepicker) looks to be six or seven. In the background priests and priestesses scurry about, all with clay tablets in hand. A statue of Inanna can made out in the distance. Bundles of barley are clustered in the corner. A table behind Gizzal displays stone idols of each of the gods listed previously, with the center idol of Inanna being the largest. 

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Excellently! Namazu, tell Kali-Dari about what we have learned.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Inanna is the Lady of Uruk. We give her our food and she… um…

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Very good. Shimusa, why don’t you help Namazu.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: We see the students from a different angle. Shimusa, the student speaking, appears to be around twelve years of age and has a wide smile as she speaks. The students all have clay tablets before them. Cuneiform writing is seen wedged into them. Namazu’s finger has returned to his nose.

            <p><u>Gizzal</u>: Fantastic, as always. Uli, tell the Kali-Dari more about our temple.

            <p>[Uli is a heavy-set boy with a thick brow and messy brown hair]

            <p><u>Uli</u>: In the name of Inanna, we of the temple then dispense the city’s bounty to the free denizens of Uruk. The Eanna temple is led by the Ensi. He is the high priest who represents the interests of the Goddess on Earth. After him is the Kali, that’s you Kali-Dari… he administers the temple and its attendants. Next, are the Nindingi and the…

            <p><u>Dari</u>: That’s enough, Uli. Thank you. It seems the lessons are coming along splendidly, Mah-Gizzal. Each of you will be priests and counters of the highest order, I am sure. 

            <p>[Dari smiles warmly]

        <h2>Page 4</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Wide view of Dari working with a tablet as he is counting bundels of Barley. He is attended by a young man in robes. In the background worshippers pass. Some priestesses are setting incense before a stone statue of Inanna.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: ...one hundred fifty three, one hundred seventy, one hundred eighty seven, two hundred two... it seems we are missing two bundels.

            <p>[He presses wedges into his tablet]

            <p><u>Young man</u>: Yes, Kali-Dari. I will let them know at once.

            <p>[The young man bows]

            <p><b>Panels 2, 3, 4, 5</b>: These small panels are arranged next to each other, across the page. In sequential order they reveal Dari’s personal cylindrical seal in his hand. It is made from crystal and has a low relief wrapped around it. The next three panels depict the seal rolling over the bottom of his tablet. The imprint to the left depicts an offering made to Inanna. Inanna is depicted amid reeds and accompanied by two lions. The high-priest, Ensi, is depicted facing towards her. Behind him, are the many people of Uruk. Behind the Ensi numerous subordinate priests stand. Each wields tools that indicate their profession. The whip for the buffalo herder, the plough for the farmer, the hoe for the gardener, the tablet for the scribe, and the net for the fisherman.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Dari stands before a crowd of people along with many female priestesses. They hand out bundels of barley to the people of Uruk. Dari calls out names.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Tilhar!.... Mesharra!.... Bilu... err...Biluqah?....

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I cannot read this one… [He whispers to a female priestess beside him.]

            <p>[The priestess looks over his shoulder at the tablet.]

            <p><u>Priestess</u>: Biluda.

            <p><b>Panel 7</b>: An view facing the crowd. A young girl emerges from the crowd and runs to Dari, she leads an even younger girl by the hand.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Biluda! <i>Thank you, priestess</i> [He whispers]

            <p><u>Young Girl (Lala)</u>: Kali-Dari!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: What is it Lala, I am busy.

        <h2>Page 5</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Lala tugs on Dari’s robes. The younger girl has her hand stretched out to Dari.

            <p><u>Lala</u>: My sister wants to see your seal, Kali-Dari. I told her that it shines like the sun.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see, and what is your sister’s name?

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Lilla.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: That is confusing.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari kneels before the two young girls. He pulls his crystal seal from a pocket in his robes.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Careful with this, Lilla.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The little girl holds the seal now. She looks at it through the sun, light from the crystal seal refracts onto her face.

            <p><u>Lilla</u>: Wooooow...

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Girls, how is your father?

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Fine. He spends more time with the buffalo than he does with mother, though.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see. Such is the nature of his calling, I suppose. I will see you all here next week, yes?

            [Dari Passes a bundel of Barley to Lala]

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Lala returns to the crowd with her sister. Dari returns the seal to his pocket.

            <p><u>Lala</u>: Of course, Kali-Dari. We cannot live on buffalo milk alone!

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: A view of the interior of the temple again. Kali-Dari prays, prostrated, before a statue of Inanna with his fellow priests and priestesses. Behind them are many of the people who have received their redistributed bundels of barley that they hold under their arms and in baskets. They pray.

        <h2>Pages 6 & 7</h2>

            <p><b>Splash</b>: A two page view of Uruk from high above. The city is expansive with the temple of Eanna sitting atop a massive Ziggurat at the center. The Ziggurat towers over the rest of the city. It is swarming with human activity and banners and painted murals decorate it much of it, top to bottom. In the distance irrigated fields of barley can be seen surrounding the city. Canals of water flow through them in grid-like patterns. The streets teem with people, goat, and buffalo.
                
        <h2>Page 8</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari leans on a half-constructed stone statue outside the temple of Eanna. He eats dates, one palm full of them, while the other throws them into his mouth. There is an older man with a chisel chipping at the statue.

            <p><u>Older Man (Kal)</u>: How’s life in the temple?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Fine, Kal. And the life of Uruk’s Master Sculptor? 
                
            <p><u>Kal</u>: Splendid! Praise Inanna, this may be my best work yet.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari looks up at the half-completed depiction, its face still an amorphous blob.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: How can you tell?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Naturally I can sense such things.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Naturally.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Kal</u>: I cannot say I am happy with the laborers the temple has provided.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari spots a man, brandishing a club, yelling at a group of laborers close to where he and Kal are standing. The laborers work on the foundation of a building.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: They seem adequate enough...

            <p><u>Kal</u>: They were borrowed from the northern settlements, but they did not come here willingly and they have little experience. Such a combination begets poor craftsmanship. And to be truthful, I regret that my works should require such hardships.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari brushes his hands against his robes after finishing the last date.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: First, they are not <i>your</i> works. They are Inanna’s.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Second, we protect these people from the mountain tribes. In return, they do work in the name of Inanna, whom they love. And, look, their work enriches our temples, allowing us to care for the people of Uruk. This is a good thing, Kal.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: I suppose.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari assesses the group of slaves again, but this time sees a young girl among their number. She hands a bowel of water to an older worker.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: A closer view of the girl’s face. She has beautiful dark eyes and a distinct birth mark that covers most of her lower jaw. She return's Dari's gaze.

            <p><u>Kal (FOP)</u>: Just look at them Dari. Wretched lot...

        <h2>Page 9</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari pries his gaze away (a look of consternation on his face) as Kal tugs his robes to get his attention. Kal gestures to the street where a large group of men are passing by.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: A wide shot of the men passing by. They are dressed in leather tunics and skirts. Most of them wield slings or large wooden clubs. Two or three at the front of the group have axes of flint, gleaming obsidian daggers, or spears with copper tips. Many of them look terrified.

            <p><u>Dari (FOP)</u>: Ahh. A lion devoured a travelling administrator, two days past. The Ensi commanded that a lot be drawn to determine the band that would track the beast and capture the beast. Once they return, the Ensi plans to slay the captured beast himself.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: A view of Dari and Kal as the last of the amateur lion trackers pass by.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Potters and weavers going lion hunting… Inanna protect them. 

            <p>[Kal shakes his head.]</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: They are led by Uruk’s greatest hunters, Kal. Besides, they won’t be killing it, just tracking it.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: And capturing it... they look petrified, Dari. They aren’t meant for that sort of work.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: <i>Everybody</i> in Uruk is subject to be drawn in a lot, Kal. Regardless of station.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: A silent panel as Kal considers this and continues to chip away at his statue.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari turns and starts to walk away.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: <i>Everybody...?</i>

            <p>[Dari throws his head down in exasperation.]</p>

            <p><u>Dari</u>: We are too important to the temple and to the Ensi, Kal. Although I do not know why he values you so, old man. You are feeble-minded and your statues are horrendous.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Haha! That’s the Goddess you’ve just insulted, Dari!

        <h2>Page 10</h2>
                
            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: A view of Uruk at night. The moon hangs full in the sky. It is deep orange and shines on the city below. Torches wrap around tiers of the Ziggurat, though the rest of the city is largely dark.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: We return to the temple interior. Dari points as he instructs temple attendants while they carry things up the stairs of the temple.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: An angle of the street leading away from the temple. Up the street, a small girl watches Dari and the workers.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari stops what he is doing, perhaps sensing the girl's gaze. He looks at the girl.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: It is the northern girl that he saw earlier in the day, the one with the birthmark on her chin. The moon’s orange light illuminates her face. Her dark eyes reflect the light.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: She turns away and darts into a nearby alley.

            <p><b>Panel 7</b>: Close-up of Dari’s face. He looks perplexed. There is something about this girl.

        <h2>Page 11</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari trots down the street toward the alley she disappeared into.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: A view from behind Dari as he pokes his head into the alley. He sees her turn a corner into another alley.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari emerges into a lit courtyard. There are a dozen men and women drinking and laughing around a fountain. He is already breathing heavily, slouching from fatigue.  

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari gingerly steps around the revelers and spots something ahead.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: From Dari’s perspective, we see the girl, just barely, as she disappears down yet another alleyway.

        <h2>Page 12</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari peers down the alley the girl has just turned down. It has an almost comically steep incline ascending almost as if toward to the orange moon that hangs above.

            <p>[A word balloon with a question mark hovers over Dari’s head.]</p>

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari looks back before he ascends. The revelers he had passed are now gone. No trace of them remains.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari scrambles up the steep alleyway. The sky above him has taken on an unnatural, pink-purple hue.
                
            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari continues climbing. The alley is somehow even steeper. The houses surrounding him are now slightly lop-sided. Odd, non-cuneiformic symbols are painted on the walls. Purple light bathes the area around him.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari reaches the top of the incline and then emerges from the alley. He is now bathed in a brilliant, shimmering blue light. He squints towards its source.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Same angle as above. Dark drops to his knees. 

        <h2>Page 13</h2>

            <p><b>Full Page</b>: We see what Dari sees: an open courtyard with a Goddess at its center. This Goddess is unlike Inanna or any of the other gods referenced earlier. She walks elegantly out of a yawning, teardrop-shaped rupture in the scenery. Her exceptionally long hair floats in the air as if she were submerged in water, reaching out like tendrils towards the northern girl. The goddess has a dark complexion and eyes like prisms. The spatial maw from which she emerges reveals glimpses of floating amorphous blobs of light. Impossibly, there is no longer a moon in the sky but two planets. The larger one is dark red while the other is black. The buildings surrounding the courtyard seem to be leaning towards the Goddess, seemingly ready to buckle and collapse. The Goddess augustly extends a hand to the young girl. The young girl is on her knees, praying.

        <h2>Page 14</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: A close-up of Dari. Tears stream down his face as he stares in awe. A wash of colors bathe his face. (Think Dave in the climax of <i>2001.</i>)

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari faints.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: All black.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari awakes suddenly. A stick prods his face.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: We see it is the child Namazu (the nosepicker) who wields the stick.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Kali-Dari...?

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Dari is on his feet, spinning. The courtyard he is in appears completely normal. A crowd has gathered and watches him, amused.

            <p><u>Namuzu</u>: Kali-Dari...? Are you ok?

        <h2>Page 15</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Through passing crowds we see Dari talking with Kal again. He gesticulates, seemingly describing to Kal what he witnessed the night before. Kal has stopped chipping away at his statue, listening with a bewildered, yet bemused, expression on his face.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: A closer view of the conversation. We can hear them now.
                
            <p><u>Dari</u>: Where is the girl?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: One of the workers, you say? She was here yesterday? 

            <p><u>Dari</u>: She had a birthmark covering much of her jaw...

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Kal gestures to the foundation the workers had been building the day before. There are no more workers, just tools and construction refuse.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: They are no longer here, Dari. They were ordered to return to their village. Low yields they must tend to, I believe.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Bah! Which village? To the north, correct?

            <p><u>Kal</u>: <i>Enki save me…</i> How should I know?! What is so special about this girl?

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari has turned around. His head is in his hand, his eyes closed pensively.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: It was a miracle. She performed a miracle, Kal. I saw it with mine own eyes.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: A miracle? A little northern girl? I suppose stranger things have happened… what exactly did she do?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: She summoned and convened with a goddess, Kal.

            <p>[Beat]</p>

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Well, that certainly would be a miracle…

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari has turned around and now briskly walks away, his gait filled with purpose.

            <p><u>Kal</u>: Wait! Dari! Which goddess was it?!

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I don’t know!

        <h2>Page 16</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari is in the temple asking a group of priestesses questions. The priestesses shake their heads.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari speaks with his subordinate, Gizzal, as some children eavesdrop. Gizzal shakes his head.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari speaks to a man surrounded by clay tablets stacked upon each other to reckless heights. He shakes his head.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari speaks to two young men who point at spots on a tablet with a map wedged into its clay. They appear to be giving Dari directions.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari prays before the statue of Inanna.

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari exits Uruk through its main gates. Many people flow in and out of the city. Shepherds herd buffaloes and goats. Farmers carry bundles of barley to and from the city. Merchants trade their wares to passersby. Dari carries a walking stick as he makes his way down the road with a certain bounce to his step: a man on a mission.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari is farther down the road, walking briskly. There are fewer people.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Even farther now. Only two or three people can now be seen. 

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: He is now alone on the road, walking at a more measured pace.

        <h2>Page 18</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Farther along, an old man approaches from the opposite direction.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Greetings!

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: They approach each other.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Greetings, my friend. Inanna guides us.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: They stop before each other as the old man begins rummaging through his satchel. 

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Yes yes, so I’m told. How about an exchange? I have dates if you have water.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: The two sit on a large log beneath the shade of a date palm, together on the side of the road. The old man drinks water from a skin while Dari chews pensively on dates.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: What brings a priest outside of the city?
            
            <p><u>Dari</u>: I’m looking for a girl. A special girl. She is of the northern lands, I believe.
                
            <p><u>Old Man</u>: I see. And what’s so special about this northern girl.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Same as above, though now Dari is drinking from the water skin and the old man basks in the shade.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I witnessed her communal with a god. 

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Mhm.
 
            <p><u>Dari</u>: You don’t seem impressed by that. Does the idea not excite you, old man?

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Why should it?

            <p><u>Dari</u>: Ha. Why shouldn’t it?

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: The old man rises to his feet and audibly cracks his back. Dari shakes his head as he returns the skin to his satchel.

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: Where I hail, such communions are common indeed, youngling.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: I see, and where do you hail?

            <p><u>Old Man</u>: You wouldn’t know it.

            <p><u>Dari</u>: What a surprise...

        <h2>Page 19</h2>
            
            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: The old man sits down, ignoring Dari’s comment.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Tell me, youngling...

                <p><u>Dari’s</u>: I’m 55.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: The man slaps his knee and flashes a wide grin, revealing several missing teeth.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: ...and I’m 82. That makes you young!

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: He stops, a slightly confused look on his face.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Now, where was I...
                    
                <p><u>Dari</u>: I do not know.
                        
            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: The old man’s eyes brighten as he remembers.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Oh yes, what are your designs with the girl? Give her robes, induct her into your clan?  
                    
                <p><u>Dari</u>: No. I merely wish to ask the name of the goddess she summoned. I will then record the name.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: I see. Why is this goddess’ name so important?

                <p><u>Dari</u>: I am certain that she is unknown to me. She is not scriven in any records.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: The old man thinks, head in hand.

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: That doesn’t answer my question.

                <p><u>Dari</u>: Because names are vital, old man. And our knowledge even more so. It is my duty to add this knowledge to the repositories of the temple. For posterity...

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Well, I wish you the best, I suppose. Although you might encounter trouble.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: The old man rises from his seat and begins squatting, his knees audibly cracking, as he begins preparing to return to the road. Dari looks up at the old man.
            
                <p><u>Dari</u>: Why do you say that?

                <p><u>Old Man</u>: Not all Gods wish to be named, youngling.

        <h2>Page 20</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari enters a large town. Potters ply their elaborately painted wares in nearby stalls.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: He passes through crowds. This town is not as large or busy as Uruk, but still has its merchants and craftsmen plying their trade. Though, the herders and farmers are more prevalent. Uruk representatives can be seen counting bundles of barley before a farmer, his head bowed in deference. 

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: A local woman directs Dari towards a building across the street.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari enters the building where two men are playing some sort of game, throwing small wooden trinkets onto the floor.

                <p><u>Dari</u>: Good day. I am Kali-Dari of Uruk. This is a temple outpost, yes?

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: The men, caught unawares, stand up suddenly.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Yes, Kali-Dari! What service may we provide?</p>

                <p><u>Dari</u>: I am looking for a girl who would have passed through this town. Maybe two or three days past. She has a birthmark across her chin.

                <p>[Dari gestures across his chin with his open palm]</p>

                <p><u>Man #2</u>: Yes! I remember her! Hard to miss. Queer little thing. She and her father were returning to their village. Should be three villages down the northerly road, Kali-Dari.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Dari is now outside as the two men escort him.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Kali-Dari, you should know, a lion prowls this area. It devoured our resident scribe. And our riverwright. And several locals as well. 

                <p><u>Man #2:</u> ...and several locals as well.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Yes, thank you. I have been informed of the beast. The Ensi plans to slay the creature himself.

                <p><u>Man #1:</u> Well, pardon my saying so, Kali-Dari, but he’d best do so soon. Some of our men fear travelling to the neighboring villages to collect tribute. 

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I will alert the Ensi as soon as I return to Uruk, my friends. Or perhaps I shall slay the beast myself? Haha. 

        <h2>Page 21</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari enters a small village as the sun sets. There are markedly fewer people here, and the appearance of the village differs from the town. There are fewer abodes of timber, and more of reeds and mudbrick. 

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari notices some commotion at the center of the town where the locals are gathered.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: He approaches the scene. Two men yell over each other, though the words cannot be made out. One of the men is clearly a local, while the other is an administrator of some sort from Uruk. Dari asks someone nearby he recognizes, by his dress, as a Uruk native as well.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> What is happening here?

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> Kali-Dari! What brings you so far out of the city?!

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Temple business. Tell me, why are they shouting at each other?

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: The collector gestures to the two men as he explains.

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> We arrived this evening to collect tribute, Kali-Dari. However, this village’s harvest was notably lacking. Suspiciously so, claims our supervisor. He suspects they have been pilfering.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: We see Dari’s gaze land on a small boy who stands close to the arguing local. The boy appears emaciated, his stomach protruding.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Pilfering seems unlikely...

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: Same view as Panel 4.

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> That may be so, but it seems we have upset their leader.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Their <i>leader</i>?

                <p><u>Collector #1:</u> Yes, Kali-Dari. It is so. I was just as surprised as you. Some of these far-flung villages have established a marginal hierarchy of sorts. For example, take this raving man, he has quite the head for numbers. Better than me, anyways. So, I think, for this, he argues on behalf of his people.

        <h2>Page 22</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: The local leader stops yelling, seemingly mid-sentence, as he spots Kali-Dari.

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: The local man stalks to Kali-Dari with Collector #2 hurriedly trailing him.

                <p><u>Leader:</u> Priest! This must stop! We cannot pay these loathsome tributes any longer!

                <p>[Dari raises his palms as if to sooth the man]</p>

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Calm yourself. Tell me your troubles.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The local leader puts two fingers up, impertinently close to Dari’s face. The collectors both cringe. 

                <p><u>Leader:</u> Two! We have been paying tribute to two towns! For months! If this persists, we will not be able to feed ourselves through winter.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I see. That should not be the case. I will take this matter to the temple, personally. I promise you this.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari points to Collector #1.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> You. Hand me a tablet.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari produces his crystal seal.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: A view over the tablet as Dari rolls the seal across the bottom.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> You are relieved of your duty to the temple. At least until we can settle this matter. I <i>will</i> discuss this with the Ensi, my friend.

        <h2>Page 23</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: The leader spits onto the ground. Dari takes a step back, affronted.

                <p><u>Leader:</u> It is the Ensi who harries us so!

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari’s demeanor flares as he loses his temper for the first time.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Enough! Watch your tongue! The Ensi sows order in this land! You owe him your life!

                <p><u>Leader:</u> Order!? Ha! We have known order long before Uruk infested this land like rats. This is not order, this is...is.. confusion!

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: The man storms off with the emaciated boy trailing behind him, gripping his father’s skirts.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: Dari throws his hands up in frustration as he turns away. The collectors look to each other with relief in their eyes, as if the worst outcome had been avoided. The people of the village disperse. 

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: The sun is down now. Dari rests against a rock, his head leaning against his fist. The moon hangs above, a slightly pink tone to its hue.

            <p><b>Panel 6</b>: He closes his eyes and falls asleep.

        <h2>Page 24</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: Dari has resumed his journey. He walks down the road, alone.     

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari reaches another village. This village is primarily composed of homes of the reed and mudbrick variety. As he fills his waterskin at a well, a young woman approaches him. Very few people can be seen.

                <p><u>Young Woman (Kash):</u> A long way from Uruk, priest.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I know.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Have you come to trade?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> No.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Shame. I am craving pomegranate.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Dari drinks from his waterskin.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> I hear that Uruk smells like shit. Is this true? A passing riverwright once told me the whole city smells of dog shit.

                <p>[Kari Doesn't Answer]</p>

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Well, it smells like shit here. And if it smells like shit here, it must almost certainly smell like a mountain of shit in Uruk.

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: A silent panel as Dari thoughtfully considers the question. Beads of water drip from his beard.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Dari returns his waterskin to his satchel.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> That is a wise assumption.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Hah hah! I knew it.

                <p>[Beat]</p>

                <p><u>Kash:</u> I am Kash.

                <p>[Beat]</p>

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Dari.

        <h2>Page 25</h2>

            <p><b>Panel 1</b>: The two of them now walk through the village together.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> What brings you so far from Uruk?

            <p><b>Panel 2</b>: Dari follows Kash under a tree. There are other youths there, lounging in the shade. They look up at Dari and Kash and watch as the two converse.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> I am looking for a girl.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> Long way to come for a girl. There must be thousands of girls in Uruk.

            <p><b>Panel 3</b>: Same as above.

                <p><u>Dari:</u> This girl is unique. She shares some...connection with a goddess.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> A goddess?

                <p><u>Dari:</u> Yes. I witnessed the communion. The goddess was… immaculate. Her exalted form was truly beyond my humble ken...

            <p><b>Panel 4</b>: A silent pause as Kash (and the eavesdropping youths) consider Dari's words.

            <p><b>Panel 5</b>: Kash offers her response, her palm casually extended.

                <p><u>Kash:</u> “Mmhmm, I see. Tell me, are you looking to fuck this Goddess?”

                <p>[The youths explode in laughter]</p>
