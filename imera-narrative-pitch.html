                    The planet of Imera resides in a trinary star system: the <b>"Tri-Part Sphere"</b>.

                    Due to the erratic orbital patterns incurred by a trinary system, Imera is periodically subject to planetwide cataclysms that eliminate all life.

                    Each star is actually an extra-dimensional artifact that grants unique properties to the planet, Imera:

                            The first star, <b>Proi</b>, originated in a terrible heavenly universe. When Imera orbits Proi, the planet is infested with murderous angels of heaven. (Religious-Horror)

                            The second star, <b>Nýchta</b>, originated in a universe in which advanced technological civilizations ruled. When Imera orbits Nýchta, the planet is granted properties which enable the construction of impossibly advanced scientific technologies: force fields, cryogenic chambers, AIs, FTL drives, etc. (Science Fiction).

                            The third star, <b>Kesh</b>, originated in a universe with magic and fantastical creatures. When Imera orbits Kesh, the planet is granted magical properties and is populated by unique fantasy creatures. (Fantasy)

                    An <b>Age of Brilliance</b> refers to the periods in which Imera enters a stable orbit around one of the systems’ three stars. Each Age of Brilliance is named, in turn, for the star Imera orbits at that time: <i>Age of Proi</i>, <i>Age of Nýchta</i>, and <i>Age of Kesh</i>.

                    The narrative of <i>Imera</i> is set during the waning years of an Age of Kesh as the planet begins to drift from that magic-granting star. As a result, an endless winter threatens to extinguish humanity, and magic itself has begun to fade.

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>It is an Age of Brilliance on the planet Imera. The star, Kesh, enables not only life to thrive on Imera, but magic as well. Cataclysm looms, however, as an endless global winter has descended and the magic of the Imeran people wanes. Our hero, Andrikos, must set out into the wilds of Imera to seek the rumored subterranean cities of the ancients in an effort to ascertain the nature of these troubles. </p>

            <p>In the process, Andrikos will unthaw cryogenically frozen ancients — hailing from an Age of Nýchta — who will reveal to him the deadly fate of Imera. The planet drifts from Kesh, Andrikos learns, and all life will soon be extinguished by the cold vacuum of space. To prevent this Andrikos must complete the objective that the ancients had begun so long ago: he must restore and use their ancient technologies to move the entire planet of Imera to another dimension. Andrikos is opposed by murderous angels and other celestial creatures that are remnants of an Age of Proi.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay in Brief</h2>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0; text-align: left;">

                    Real-time combat system with magical skills and technological weapons/equipment at the player’s disposal. Players must balance a magic-stamina system while honing their prowess with the weapon and equipment systems.
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0.2em; color: #f1b86c; font-size: 1em;">▲</span>
                    Players activate ancient, dormant technologies by imbuing them with magical energy.
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0.2em; color: #f1b86c; font-size: 1em;">▲</span>
                    Kinetic magic enables traversal and the manipulation of environments to solve environmental puzzles. 
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0.2em; color: #f1b86c; font-size: 1em;">▲</span>
                    Ancient technologies enable increasingly deadly modes of combat. This includes both melee and shooter mechanics. 
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0.2em; color: #f1b86c; font-size: 1em;">▲</span>
                    Players discover unique items and immersive, revelatory lore through exploration, unearthing ancient caches, environmental storytelling and engaging NPC side-quests. 
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">

                    Lore revealed in the critical path is surface level only. Extensive environmental storytelling compels players to explore and learn details of the game world. Further, cryptic and sometimes contradictory lore drops will create uncertainty. 
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">

                    “Pockets of Proi” act as physical zones in the game from which psychopathic angels and other heavenly enemies emerge. 
                </li>
                <li style="position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">

                    Four endings: “Proi,” “Nýchta,” “Imera,” and “Escape.” Each triggered by actions players make during crucial story points.

            <h2>Story Integration</h2>
            <p>The story of Imera is told through the completion of main quests, side-quests, and through environmental storytelling. By completing the main quest, players will learn the basics of the setting and story. This includes knowledge of the trinary nature of the star-system, of the impending cataclysm, and of the true nature of Proi and Nýchta and their influence on Imera. For example, by simply finishing the game, players will learn that this planet was once home to an advanced civilization that wielded technologies beyond comprehension. This will include knowledge of certain key technologies such as cryogenic chambers, teleportation devices, etc.</p>

            <p>By completing side-quests, players will learn more of the current inhabitants of Imera, the planet’s broader history (reaching back billions of years), and the precise nature of the three Ages of Brilliance. For instance, players will learn through quest-givers of ancient myths that make (sometimes oblique) reference to Nýchtan epochs long-past. Other angelic quest givers may be engaged that illuminate the nature of Proi and its terrible legions, even allowing for Andrikos to pursue the “Proi” ending. </p>
            
            <p>Environmental storytelling will suggest details of the setting otherwise kept from the players. For example, observant players will see no stars, except for Proi and Nýchta, fill the night sky of Imera, as only two large moons illuminate the earth below. Later, players may see diagrams littering the floor of an ancient fallen one chamber that imply there are no other stars outside the Imeran System: it rests at the center of an empty universe. Perhaps a nearby journal tells of an ancient Nýchtan astronomer’s fruitless efforts to locate other stars. By exploring and scrutinizing the environment, players will learn how the Nýchtans lived and what kind of technologies they had access to. The details gleaned from these sources, however, will sometimes contradict one another, implying a lack of consensus on certain subjects. Further, players will find remnants of an Age of Proi. These “Pockets of Proi” will often contain the angelic edifices of those epochs (along with the grotesque angels that yet inhabit them).</p>
           
            <p>In short, the main story is intended to titillate the player with its grand narrative and high-stakes conflict. But it is the environment, items, and the side-quests that will paint a broader picture, allowing players to investigate, theorize, and hopefully engage in discussions with others regarding the game’s abundance of clues.</p>
