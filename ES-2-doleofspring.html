        <p>Walking with Phet’s disembodied voice down the corridor, I could see other tau and could hear the chattering of other servitors like Phet filling the area. The corridor was white, long, and windowless, except, that is, when the occasional tau would approach the wall and ask for a view of the exterior. A window would then appear — although I knew then they were more like digital screens. Some chose to look at the inner side of the torus, not unlike the view from my room. How many of them were like me? Disoriented and adrift.</p>

        <p>Other times they brought up views of a vista just beyond the torus. A long arc of yellow and blue light swirled lazily through space. That light, Phet informed me, was some of the last untethered matter in the universe. Black holes had long ago absorbed most of the universe’s matter, pulling it in through their immense gravitational fields. Over countless eons, stars, gas clouds, and even smaller black holes were consumed, "leaving behind a desolate cosmos dominated by its very killers," as Phet bleakly put it. "And with the concentration of matter into black holes, so too came a scarcity of accessible energy. However, taukind had planned for this very eventuality. For, while we aestivated, we positioned ourselves next to matter's final resting places such as this."</p>

        <p>I wondered to myself how many times Phet had made this exact same monologue to me. A hundred times? A million?</p>

        <p>To fill the silence, Phet continued:</p>

        <p>“Though standard sources of energy have long blown away, taukind now relies largely on energy harvested from black holes. You see, holes such as Ryde’s Largess (that is, the black hole we orbit at this very moment) are very energetic indeed. They reside in a dense sea of plasma; this sea of plasma, the ergosphere, exists just outside the event horizon. And that plasma, conveniently, provides a potent magnetic field. That magnetic field then spins the ergosphere and its constituent plasmas close to the speed of light. We then capture that burst and…”</p>

        <p>I interjected, “Energy at 150% efficiency... right?”</p>

        <p>“Very good, Dallat. And, lucky for us, holes such as Ryde’s will be here for a very, very long time. And thus, so too shall we… in theory at least. Though our most demanding operation — the running of Schemes — requires a much more powerful source of energy.”</p>

        <p>As we walked through the looping hallway, Phet continued to fill in the gaps, though I began to recall much on my own. Each Scheme was like a world unto itself. Simulating a universe was out of the question. A simulation of that magnitude would require a near-infinite source of energy to draw from — the total energy output of the universe, to be exact. But Schemes were indeed able to create worlds; that is their primary function. Any non-relevant past (or future) of a Scheme was calculated and quasi-realized before the desired time and conditions of the simulated environment were met. Epochs of celestial history, the formation of planets, the grueling crawl to intelligent life: all condensed into mere microseconds. Further, all superfluous data was only generated when needed. Within a Scheme, when a scientist looked through a telescope at the stars, or through a microscope to examine unseen particles, the subject in question would be there, as if waiting, though it had only just been computed.</p>

        <p>Once a Scheme was generated, participants would join to live out a new life. Again, these Schemes, run in perpetuity, required energy: the first reason for the Dormancy. For aeons, taukind aestivated. During this time, galaxy-trawling von Neumann automatons tirelessly stripped the galaxy of all its parts, quietly accumulating and converting mass into energy. Much of the Milky Way’s stellar mass — and later Andromeda’s once the Milkomeda coalesced — was converted for this purpose. After the entire universe had degenerated past any reasonable utility, these machines returned to taukind, nurtured our peaceful slumber, and waited for many more billions of years for us to awaken. And taukind slept, waiting for the latent temperature of the universe to reach its nadir: the second reason. </p>

        <p>In my mind's eye I imagined the poles of long-dead Earth. The desolate icy landscapes where no life was welcome and where winters stubbornly persisted. Only now the winter was truly endless, and life seemed to be flourishing.</p>

        <p>Once returned to the waking world, taukind used this immoderate surplus to generate Schemes in perpetuity, with black holes serving as supplemental energy sources to power the basic operations of humanity’s final homes. Phet then turned to the future: "Take into consideration that each Scheme simulates an experience much longer than its actual run-time; all tau will, essentially, live for an eternity. Though while taukind has only recently left its dormant state, having been awake for a little over one decieon — a blink of an eye, considering — projections forecasts that most, if not all, tau will persist indefinitely. That is unless one <i>choses</i> death over life."</p>

        <p><i>Death over life</i>. That was a sentiment I now understood well. Once again, these nascent understandings, though familiar, made me uneasy. The scope of these facts defied logic, defied common sense. If I were still a proper human, I’d likely puke in the nearest waste bucket, I thought.</p>

        <p>According to Phet, the looping corridor we followed would lead us to a chamber called the Curlicue. As we neared our destination, Phet’s disembodied voice continued to follow me, its words always seeming to emerge from a place several feet in front of me.</p>

        <p>“So, Ryde’s keeps the lights on?” I asked.</p>

        <p>“That it does,” Phet answered.</p>

        <p>“And what is this place, then? This place we’re in?”</p>

        <p>“We reside in the residential-class habitat known as ‘The Dole of Spring.’”</p>

        <p>“The Dole of Spring…” I repeated, hesitant.</p>

        <p>“Yes, I agree, dreadfully sentimental.” Phet sighed. “Ahh. We’ve arrived. ‘The Curlicue’ — another questionable appellation. Aandh should be inside with the others. Just call if you need me, yes?”</p>
